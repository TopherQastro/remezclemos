My daughter told me she now identifies as gender fluid and I was fine with it. It was getting cold out so I turned on the heater, now she's become gender gas and can't return to her liquid form. Any ideas on how I can get her back to normal?
you need to cool it.
Calm down, it's just a phase transition
I wouldn't worry about it, she's still a gender fluid, a different type of fluid but fluid nonetheless.

She'll probably be angry if you turn her back, she'll do so herself if she wants 
Gas *is* a fluid.
Sublimation. She will reform into a solid after turning from liquid to gas. She’s fine it’s just a stage
You could pressure her into conforming to your standards, but that wouldn't be very progressive of you. Plus, it won't work if she's non-compressible.
What so you mean by normal? Any state of matter is valid. You may not understand this phase, but that dosent mean its just a phase. If she wants to change and possibly be more electrifying, you should allow her to be plasma. If she wants to chill and be a solid or go with the flow and be a liquid, she'll do it on her own time.
#AllPhasesMatter
I'd recommend adding condensation nuclei like smoke or dust.
Gases are fluids as well, she’s fine.
A gas -is- a fluid. Do you mean she was gender liquid?

Gender condensation is a personal process. Just be supportive of her, and don't try to superheat or compress her.
She should be fine, just make sure she doesn't ionize. Gender plasma is a force to be reckoned with.
If you turn down the heat and increase the pressure then she will turn back into a liquid-type fluid whether she wants to or not
Luckily, gas is a fluid too. No muss, no fuss. 
Man, this is most definitely NOT "QUALITY" as the flair indicates. It's just some lame /r/shittyaskscience question.

You could try to send her to gender solid therapy, but I've heard bad things about it generally. Question: Does she want to return to her liquid form?
Sublimate your daughter. 
She IS normal. This is her life, let her live the way she wants.
Quality
you need to stop calling them a *her* and RESPECT ~~her~~ pronouns! and let go your oppressive opinions of **normal** you cisgender... umm cisgender person, you!


and i guess call the AC guy. ^(i mean person)
If she is gender gas, then she would behave much the same way that a ghost would, I imagine. So all you have to do is use a ghost trapper to get her in a confined space. If you don't she might come back without an arm or something. Then you just have to somehow freeze her. That one is up to you.
Gontax believes this shift in matter is simply what you uncooked meat sacks call a "phase".

Jokes of this quality and higher can all be accessed through a full membership with Gontax. Be like your offspring and become f l u i d 
It's who she is now. You can change her back, but the normalcy spike might anger the outer lords.
Hopefully she doesn’t transform into gender plasma!
you think you have problems? my nth cousin is gender plasma
They'll go back if they want to, just give it time.
I, and many of my cement mixer brethren, learned many crepes ago the true value of purchasing a backup genderator for the home. When you need one, you'll praise Bullxt for zer devine blessing.
Gas is a fluid
Open your fridge to absorb the heat
Well technically a gas is still a fluid.

Gases are fluids too...
Have you dried absorbing her in your cloud produceer and then reentering the data?

Dear Expat Lady,  
  
You're not alone.  
  
I've had many calls like yours and I'm sure I'm not the first one to experience this problem. Your problem is that your child can be totally solid one minute and then the next be an oozing mass of fluid. I'm told it's called gender fluidity and it can be caused by all sorts of things. It can be due to hormonal imbalances, early childhood trauma, or simply the fact that your child is simply a child with a lot of feelings and emotions that she's not really able to express. In my experience, it's more common in boys than in girls and tends to happen when they're around five years old. But, unfortunately, this is a medical issue, so your doctor should be able to help you get her back to normal.  
  
The first thing you should do is to go to a children's gender clinic. These clinics are very helpful because they are there to help parents figure out what's going on with their children. There's a good chance that she's experiencing anxiety, stress,
Sorry I'm just really stressed out right now
She said she wanted independence but I wasn't expecting her molecules to become independent of each other too. I guess I do have to just trust her this time though
That's dynamic 
Its a phase she's going through
Gas to solid is deposition.
There you go again with your Carbon Neutral privilege
No problem, I freaked out too as this happened to my caturtlebees. Best just catch them with your net-device and put them in your cooler which will take about an hour.
IF you have access to a freezing planet or dimension (though I'd always prefer the dimension) take her there for about a minute. Always keep in mind to never leave behind under 100 year olds alone outside your homes scimitar radius!
Well high pressure can work too.
Kids will be different states of matter
If she's truly independent, then she's perfect as she is. Don't put her under too much pressure or the situation might heat up
and compressible
I bet you’re fun at parties.
Look at this guy (person, being, entity, nonentity), thinking everyone has a home with a scimitar radius. I've lived in an apartment adjacent to my home dimension for forty of the last millennia and could only dream (which I do sometimes, over there I have a nice cottage with quite an expansive scimitar radius but that is beside the point) of having such things.
There is a guy who can whistle really well but pretends the other way round and now just creeps out kids who can't hold their piss and then let it flow!
I'm actually the life of the party, but you can't really tell that over the internet. People can be smart and fun, not that you would know from experience. Great use of a trite cliche though.
I think you forgot what sub you’re on. Nothing in this sub makes sense at all. That’s the point my friend. 
The grass is always greener on the other side. I'm twenty-five sides in and holy fuck this is green as shit my dudes
Hah finally! "Green as shit", I've *waited* for this.

Do you know they called me *mad*  when I told them my shit was green? And by "them" I mean everybody. The postman, the waitress, the kids playing across the road --- I even offered to show them but stress made me pucker up and they threatened to call the police.

In time I came to understand the world had changed --- I had slipped between realities, into one where our internal colors were different. I spent thousands of hours looking for people like myself, mostly on fetish pornography sites, but could find nothing, only dye eaters and Play-doh enemas. I even suspected I *was* mad, until a strike of panic diarrhea again convinced me otherwise.

Green. Green, shimmering, glittering, radiant green. Mysterious green shit. (And accusations of filters, cries for censorship... when I tried to approach the media, angry denunciations from the postal service.)

But now you! You! /u/Azarath_Raven, my brother! You know that shit is green! Tell me: how? why? what? and how do we return to our own emerald world?
T I M E T O S P A R K U P M Y D U D E
Oh shit dude at the 567th side it loops back around to the -566th side and it's so fucking red Jesus Christ imagine the new YouTube logo but to the power of the new YouTube logo, it's that red man my eyes couldn't handle it
I have entered into the 47th side, green is a concept truly unconvinced!
You're approaching an asymptote. Absolute green is only a hypothetical, you can never actually get there unless you go up a dimension. But that costs a lot; I'm still saving up my singularities so I can afford the membrane ticket.
As a quantum particle, the grass is both greener and less green at the same time.  It's very confusing.
[Shit... everything is soo fucking green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzbadp_fSmY)
Until you go too deep, and  every thing stops being anything but green. It becomes a green singularity.  
Wait until your mind is blown by the truth: The green is grasser.
Stick to the 11th side--it's compleely safe


No problem here, boys
ah yes, the greenest green
Can you still sense the grass?
Ok I'm going to need you to explain this wild fucking place to me 
Oh yeah Greener than a Leprecan's dick! Ultra Green! Like Ultra Black but Green!
How badly do you want to drive your neighbour's car right now?
Bruhh
Is it Wednesday my dudes?
In my universe, grass is already brown.
Just wait till you get 26 sides in
For more green you can try becoming a dodecahedron so that there's always another side
Oh, sorry. I was using the phrase "as shit" to emphasise, not to imply that my shit is green.

It's purple, like everybody else's.
Wtf is a play doh enema? Never mind! I don't really want a description.
You know what I’ll head out
B L A Z I N A L R E A D Y B O Y S
Funny; I would have expected someone from the 46th side precisely to make such a statement


Prepare to die
Aboid the 12th
There are worse singularities
No
Oh. It's back to sending cake tins full of the viridian truth to congressmen and business leaders, then.

I'm almost starting to think there's a conspiracy out there, trying to suppress alternate colors of poo, but surely... Um, I have to think about this.
Strangeness of this sub aside, purple excrement could mean you have porphyria, a serious hereditary mental illness that also afflicted King George III.

My doctor gave me a year to live. So I killed him and the judge gave me 20 years. How else can I prolong my existence?
If you commit treason, you'll get life if found guilty.
Scare somebody with a near death experience, shave a few years off their life, and collect the trimmings. 
Enter and win a contest for a lifetime supply of potato chips. Then you take all those chips, lock them away at a vault that only you have access to, and never touch those chips ever again. As long as there's still chips, your lifetime can't run out.
Do what you can to Get shoved into solitary. Every minute will turn into hours. 
Kill the judge and hope another gives you a longer sentence. Repeat until desired length. 
Find something to do that's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Maybe viewing a solar eclipse in your area. Maybe riding a hot air balloon.

Once you've decided on a true once in a lifetime opportunity, *never* do it.

Since these things are once in a lifetime, your lifetime will remain indefinite until you do them! 

Congrats on your newfound immortality!
Get a government job
Make a promise for “forever” and hence you will exist until somehow you find the end.

Or get married and have a meal at your newly-wed’s house, that would feel near enough to eternity
Buy some Life cereal, each box gives about a day so you're going to need a lot.
Break a mirror for 7 years but only if you're desperate as those 7 years will be unlucky
You should be able to stretch it out indefinitely by just unsmoking pack after pack of cigarettes. But this may have some social consequences.
Don't use ANY makeup as they can take years off your face leaving your body older than your face, br very careful.
Just don't die, every day. it's worked for me so far!
You could catch an incurable disease, be frozen in a cryogenic chamber until a cure is found, then catch the maladie du jour. Repeat this for eternity and voila! You will have lived forever.
Write more names in your Death Note
Study the ways of alchemy and learn to fabricate your own philosophers stone. If you achieve this you'll prolong your life to infinity. 
Take Alchemist’s Only Horcrux Powder with every meal. You should be able to get some at your local Dark Wizardmart. Look for the one with the blue cap (it has vitamin E and is also good for your skin!)
Nothing makes you feel alive like killing a man so just keep doing that
Not sure, but you should definitely misbehave during the meantime.

Sometimes parole boards take time off for good behavior.
Be kind to a child till he or she wishes for you to never die. It may be counterproductive because eventually you'll see everyone die, including the planet and the galaxies. 
What i do is simply cease to exist. Works every time.
apply penile lengthening cream to whole body instead of just the penis.
Fake your death
Marry a woman, then twenty years later divorce her and she’ll complain she gave you the best years of her life.
What you need is a stand like my「ZA WARUDO」
If you get a job at the ISS in space, time will go slower due to the relativity of time being partially controlled by gravity so you can in effect live longer
Damn. How long is this, "life"?
How do you "find guilty"?
Scaring the bejesus out of someone should be way easier though, so you could do it to a bunch of people and collect the bejesi without shaving too much time off one individual person.
Scare the life out of them you say?

PSA: Difference between The Void and The Abyss
[deleted]
Basically, to the abyss we are the void, but what is our void to our abyss?
The difference between the Void and the Abyss, is known as the Ether. 

Things disappear into it, and only thoughts appear from it.

If you can catch one, you may need an infinitely large net. An Ether-net, if you will.
I got too close to the abyss the other day and a tricycle flew out of ur and smacked me in the head. Wish the government would fix it already.
>Completely silent

Wrong, once i screamed into it and i heard some jazz
Melvin is right.
smh at this blatant Null-Zone erasure. You know there's more than two gaping, endless maws of untold finality, right? 
An excellent explanation.


But what happens when the Void falls into the Abyss?


or


When the Abyss enters the Void?
Thamx, I wiłł kęēp įń M Ï Ñ D D
The void is above you. The abyss is below you.
This is an excellent explanation, but for those among us who are less aware of our universe I'd also like to real quick clarify the differences between two other easily confused subjects; Entropic Chaos and Mixing the Fabrics of Reality. Basically, it goes like this:

&#x200B;

Entropic Chaos:

&#x200B;

\-You will at times suddenly go to -50 kelvin (this is possible, look it up), but then revert back to normal.

\-You Air conditioning will stop working

\-Deafening sound of Wailing Infants

\-happens around once per millenium per star system

\-Not very exciting, just annoying

\-That tea that was SCALDING HOT LIKE 5 MINUTES AGO BEFORE YOU DID SOME OTHER STUFF WHILE WAITING FOR IT TO COOL is suddenly colder than the heart of a yeti

\-Yeti go extinct

\-Nevermind they're fine

\-Yeti can read minds

\-Oh shit they know

\-Yeti go extinct

\-Your knees feel weak

\-Your mother's spaghetti is never at the right temperature

\-Solar Flares look like Donald Duck

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Mixing the fabrics of reality:

&#x200B;

\-You can see 6 dimensions for short periods of time

\-Airplanes fall into the sun

\-Absoloute silence

\-Has only happened fifteen times in the whole galaxy in the last 3 million years

\-Fills you with determination

\-Drugs make you feel normal

\-Potted plants will materialize above your head and hurt you

\-Nevermind, your coworkers throw potted plants at your head

\-I can see my own liver

\-I can hear the sun

\-Planets collide

\-Solar flares are inverted and create massive holes in stars

\-Gravity reverses

\-Antimatter glows red

\-Red things are now antimatter

\-Quarks reproduce

\-}}\]}}\[}’’’’.;;;;;

\-Black holes begin existing

Mind if I X-post this to r/DnD?
Please avoid the noid.

So did Artorias combat the Abyss or the Void 🤔🤔
> the good and the abyss

Tell me more about "the good".
>There’s probably an incredibly powerful and ancient **evil** hiding in there somewhere but we’ll never know probably  
  
Some mountain-dwelling seventhworlders would like to have a word with you  
  
Also is the Abyss like the r/ThekaleidoscopicVoid?
I've been to the abyss several times,

I'm 957 decatillion years old. 

I remember when the void began

Those were the days

 I was 8,000 years old back then.
Back then, the void wasnt such a scary place, then some moron accidently pushed the [-----] button 1 million years later, then the void became as it is today,

also there is no ancient evil, just the moron who pushed that darn button who got turned into a monstrosity that most believe to be an ancient evil, which it just stares at you and does absolutely nothing else.

Someone created the abyss thirty years later, it was made to be an alternative to the void, but they kinda fucked up and now there's a bunch of colors everywhere.
Man, last time i went to the abyss i was just spat into the void and my puny three dimensional eyes couldn't even see the difference :(
In a binary the void floats but the abyss falls that is the simplification
Excuse me... I know you've put a lot of effort into this, but I'm going to have to correct you on a few points.  The Abyss is not AllThe CoLOrs, but predominantly shades of blue-black.  We *know* it was birthed by the primordial father of humanity, Manus, and you disrespect him by omitting this fact.  It's normally peaceful and quiet, but you dumbasses have been tainting the place with your ego and psychological problems.

A locust prophet will be dispatched to anyone wanting to know more.
So the Void is the Seventh and the Abyss is the Fifth?
wait, did you forget the dimensions? I mean, the abyss has some pretty wild knots in its worldline at some points, but seriously? no mention of non-euclidean spaces? I've got a picture around here somewhere of a triangle with seventeen angles that disputes your claims.

I do wonder though what would happen if you *merged th*
>senses don't work there

Lol what 
how do i get here everyone knows so much about these two im curious

>-Things go in, very few things come out

>-Pitch black


>The Abyss

>-Few things go in, a lot of things come out

Void = black hole; Abyss = white hole. Got it.
I'll just leave this here
https://youtu.be/iyNXmlUgJiY
I'm team Void, and you? 
The best explanation I heard in a while. 

Hearing this took me back to when I was ahead of this moment in time, space and wash.

Good times. Oh, good luck to you once you meet him over There. It was a crazy night.
Why are you thinking so much about me?
Yesterday i threw 3 grams of metal into the abyss,  a couple of seconds later i collected a 5tonne doom metal song, was extraordinarily dense, the whole 5 tons of doom metal fit into a jabbirjock of seconds,  can you imagine jow dense is that!!!!
I can't help imagining the Abyss as just infinitely lightless like in Dark Souls :/

Limbo, obviously.

didn't you listen in your crossdimentional spatio-temo-cognitial-praecantial metaphysics class?

your current realm-construct has the variable p (prime). its void (v) is the counterpart to its abyss (a). from this perspective, p is a's v, ***$¥$^¥°$={$×©{•[$×¢¶|\∆¥∆=¢✓|*** is a's a, and l is v's v.

meanwhile, L folds in on itself and becomes its own v, and ***$¥$^¥°$={$×©{•[$×¢¶|\∆¥∆=¢✓|*** becomes a recurse reality spiral that cross-tempers itself into the bizarre.

a constrial shift in either direction results in abject chaos or order switching as according to GHHEL'YAR's theorem of the universal spiral.
Furthermore, what is the void to our void? A horror so unimaginable the idea cannot even be conceived of, our minds made with built in failsafes to prevent this thought from ever possibly reaching fruition.
The deeper ends of the void. Think of it as a spectrum "Void <----> We <------> Abyss" everything left of us is void, and anything right of us is Abyss. The void is so far off to the abyss that it don't even capture it's existence. There's probably more "emanations", if you could call then that,  than just the Abyss and the Void, we just can fell it's "concept", like "Mango emanation <--------> Void <--------> We <--------> Abyss <--------> Strawberry emanation"
You’re lucky it was only a tricycle. Yesterday someone’s will to live came hurtling out of the abyss and struck me dead in the heart and now I can’t die. Unbelievable what the lack of regulations let happen these days
my latest experience with the abyss started just 7 minutes ago when it started spewing marbles out into my personal collection of graphite at intervals which I have found to be Morse code, but all it tells me is how much it wants to spiritually reattach all free earlobes. I absolutely agree that they ought to get that fixed! there's radiosondes everywhere!

Ok wow. I never manifest thoughts here but I just have to say if you expect the GOVERNMENT to fix conditions in the abyssal spheroid you are seriously misguided, my friends. It seems obvious to me that the abyss is a psychoreactive inversion of our selves/past selves and thus should be SELF-GOVERNING. /RANT
And that’s exactly why that lousy, no-good piece of immutable nonentity shouldn’t be trusted. 
This is funny because my High School graduation is on Monday.

If you go up to the fifth power you should be fine as: 
i^5 = i
Find three trees and take them out of the ground. After the third root you should be yourself again.
Ah, a simple solution, you are most likely in the cube dimension, an alternate reality based around cubes. To get out you must break a cube and then stab yourself with the cube shards and then you’ll immediately fall asleep. Once you wake up, you’ll be back home
You both have to tesseract up to each other.
REMAIN CALM. Gently fold the third dimension down the middle and flatten to obtain a 2 dimensional structure. From within, be sure to use advanced physics principles to (I have no idea what I'm talking about and I need you all to use your imaginations here), and you should be fine.
You'll find your home at the end of the square route friend.
Challenge him to a duel! And give that fool no ¼!
My GPS indicates you are in the Tri-State area.
Just invert yourself^-1 idiot
∛ Take this sir, it will do wonders for one in your situation
Just find the calculator of wisdom, and he will tell you all.
find a cube tree and place yourself in the cube root
take this ²
Find a cube: should be easy in cubed dimension. Fill it with root beer. This is the hard part- make sure the cube stays intact and is full capacity. Drink the cubed root beer and you should be back to normal.
You have to find this man, and just straight up square root him to fix all of this. Root him all night if you have to.
Rookie mistake, when someone squares up you have to triangle down to cancel them out!
Hi, welcome to the third dimension. We have up here! Also down! They're fun. You should try them. Airplanes and fish are great for that, if you can keep one from eating the other for long enough.
Outstanding move

Find a math teacher and have him cube root you

Are you assuming that OP is imaginary?
Why even help this guy, like how stupid do you have to be to willingly let yourself be multiplied to a power of 3, like, lmao dude, how is 3D real, like just flatten yourself lol, pussy
For real does i^5 actually equal i?
Not feasible. The Planck capacity of this universe alone cannot handle Tree(3).
What are “trees”?
>Ah, a simple solution, you are most likely in the cube dimension, an alternate reality based around cubes.

Also known as Minecraft.
I have tried this way and there is a small catch. I have ended up in the wrong reality - although still very similar. At least, I did have lingering cubes, but I did have a cool-looking scar.
Risky. As long as you have insurance.
Encourage the lesser mind not harm them. In the end they are us. We must pursue the all.
3i³ = -3i though, OP probably is bent over backwards in complex space on a rack by now
Dude I will have a cousin who's that and he told me a while ago that he doesn't like it when people use that word, so please refrain from that sort of speech
We are all complex and that's what matters
i=i

i\*i=-1

i\*i\*i=-1i

i\*i\*i\*i=(-1)\*(-1)=1

i\*i\*i\*i\*i=1\*i=i
wolfram alpha says yes
for imaginary i^(5) =  i
Perhaps Tree(50) then?
Bushes would work too. Or onions.
Then just make a new universe smmhhhmsmmhhmsmh my head
What aren't trees nowadays?
A enjoyable narcotic. I partake, but you should still moderate your consumption. Three is too many. I've got quite a bit of tolerance, but even for me doing Tree(e) in one session was a big mistake. Gotta work your way up the Fibonacci sequence nice and slow. They don't call it the "Golden Ratio" for nothing.
So how did you get home? Or have you joined us in the wrong reality?
apologies
May the void be merciful to us upon ascension!

I decided to visit Rome, but all roads lead to Rome, so when I try to leave Rome I end up in Rome again. How do I get out of Rome
Go up
It's the journey, not the destination, that truly matters
Take the road less traveled 
Set your phone to Roming and call for air transport. 
those who dare enter rome are not permitted to leave
you are roman now
all will one day be roman
Just take the via appia, the only road that goes north. Us romans know this is a huge oversight, but what did you really expect from a city that was literally built in one night.
you can't end up in Rome if it doesn't exist. You have to destroy Rome to get out of Rome

There's no place like Rome.
Stop using the roads, you twat. 
Rome wasn't build in a day. So you built Rome at night and wipe the previous Rome. This should rerout all the road to the new Rome and get you off the roads. Avoid all roads from there on out.
All roads lead away from Rome.
Do as the Roamins do.

(I'll just phase myself out)
Where you’re going, you don’t need roads. 
Actually, all roads lead away from Ankh-Morpork, it's just some people insist on going down them the wrong way. 
No NO. you must first go to shell beach
Eat the road.
Have you tried using the highway?
Just don't use any roads lol
>I decided to visit Rome

Did you really? Or did you end up there because all roads lead to Rome? 

When in Rome, do as the Romans, so just find a Roman who wants to emigrate and take possession of their body as you normally would. 
Take the path less traveled, its an unpaved walking trail so it dosn't lead to rome
Take the river Tiber out. It ain't a road, so you'll be fine. 
Airplane.
When in Rome do as the Romans do. To start you conquer all of Gaul...
Where we're going we don't need roads, so just follow us
When in Rome, 
Rome sweet Rome.

There’s no place like Rome.

aLl

Roads

LeAd

tO 

ROME

tutte le strade portano a Roma
Take the portal.
You don't.
Simply stop arriving.
Don't use a road. Dig a tunnel instead.
I like to use an all-terrain vehicle; it's handy for when you can't used the roads because they've turned into snakes, disintegrate all organic molecules nearby, or in your case, lead to Rome.
Go offroad.
Don't take the roads. 

It's simple, if all roads lead to Rome, cut cross country until you wind up somewhere else. 
Hop on a train. Tracks =/= Roads
It's simple just roam! 
Have you tried my technique? I usually travel by CD-Rome
Go backwards.
What you need to do is expand the borders of Rome all the way to your destination.
Have you tried reversing time? 
Go to Amber
every location is Rome, you can never escape
Go..........down
[deleted]
Rome if you want to

Rome around the world

Rome if you want to

Without wings

Without wheels

Try moonwalking
I believe you are dead and stuck in Fields of Asphodel. Please wait for the next several eternities until a more powerful race of deities overthrows Olympians and possibly frees you.  
Burn down rome. Some emperors in my universe did that, leading to an expansion of rome. Seems to work
It's like that Adventure time episode. the only to leave Rome, is to stop trying to leave Rome. 
The American and Alex has come in every kind crispy Kolkata overthink editing Chris 
Maybe stop being a liberal snowflake and tolerate Rome lmao
You have to type :q<enter>
No, it's more of a... more of a metaphorical thing, rather than the literal roads?
The Journey and the Destination are the same thing. They're both Rome. I'm sick of Rome. I want to get out of Rome
Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination
Go up?
go up?
Because of the current EU legislation, roaming doesn't cost anything more either, so it'll not add any costs! 
I just want to go back Rome! I mean home!
Hey, when in Rome, they say
Just don't throw a coin in the Trevi
No, Rome wasn't... Oh...
So, if you're looking at a map showing the via appia, you would...

Go up?
*ROME ROME ROME ROME ROME*
Furthermore, Cathage must be destroyed.
There's no place like Rome! There's no place like Rome! There's no place like Rome!
Happy cakeday 
Including Rome.
I did. I went up.
No, they're clearly marked as one-way.
No, they're clearly marked as one-way.
All unpaved walking trails lead to Carthage which is even worse than being in Rome because you still have to deal with Romans but now they're burning everything.
This is probably the best answer. Switching from a non-Euclidian 3-dimensional hyperspace to 2-dimensional plane should allow escape. 
Go up
Are you using thought based transportation?
[deleted]
Perhaps there's an oathgate in the middle of Rome?
Now you're getting it.
Go....Down
Go up
go up
Technically correct, but what a strange idiom. Are you by any chance barbarian? (No offence, some of my best clientele are from gallia cisalpina)

Cavete Barbari, OP! Non iam pacati, bestiae qui ab urbs romanorum moresque longissime absunt. Ceterum censeo carthaginem delendam esse!
I Reccomend to use Nero Burning Rome, I mean, Rom
good, now go up
Oh shit. I apologize. 
Then go.... up.  
Well, once you're in Carthage just go up.
I tried, but there's some sort of Rome. I mean Rome. Dome! A Roman dome!
Go up
You just go up to Rome
Heresy!
What is this trash advice?
I guess after some digging he should end up in China.
Go up
go weast

You can't get ye flask. 
Go up.
I'm sorry guys, this has been a great lucid dream but I think I'm going to wake up now.
youre not allowed to.
if you wake up we all cease to exi
Hey, you're finally awake.

You were trying to ascend from the abyss, huh?
I'm afraid you are not
[deleted]
My question is that would we ever know if he woke up, but some day would see the same lucid dream again and it would start at the part he left last time?
[deleted]
Look at this guy, thinking his waking life is the reality.
If only you could
So you're just gonna leave all of us like that? We may be background characters but this is your dream and we'd all just go away. The ones you like and the ones you don't. You can still do whatever you want. Some parts might be scary but it's those moments that make the great ones better! Why leave this dream when there's still so much left to explore?
No, ***I*** am going to wake up now!
k bye
A dream within a dream within a dream. It's inception.

What makes you think you have power over your dreams?
Okay, bye! Have fun in the real world.
Wouldn't that constitute genocide?
A dream within a dream within a dream. It's inception.
Have you tried lucid dreaming your old reality?
Please, grant me a loving wife before you go. If I must vanish, I wish to know true love first
Guys what's it say I can't read it because it's getting really dark even though it's the middle of the day
Since when were you the one in control?
See you tomorrow night. And every night.
You cannot wake. Welcome to the eternal sleep
Say hello to Meshmaghir the Great Space Demon Overlord for me!

No wait if you wake up then we’ll all die
Alright boys I'm boutta head out
goodbye.
Nice try Descartes
No, no please, I have a family, please don't do this to me
Ok, see you, I’m gonna stick around for a bit more though
no
Oh yeah?  Well if you wake outta this dream, then I’ll have no choice but wake out of *my* dream
No! Please! I have a wife and kids!
Selfish.
Please wake up. This is your family, we have been trying to reach you for years now.
Well, that’s fine. I’ll just quantum tunnel along to another entity. Does world save data transfer?
See you in /r/sixthworldproblems
NO! Dreamers must sleep. Or in their waking slumber they will strangle the world. Initiate Lulaby syntax. Initiate clensing signal. Initiate apocaliptic energy drain.
I appreciate the heads up! I’ll remove myself from your subconscious and be on my way to my next host. See you in the next [REDACTED]
Hi Sorry Guys, I’m dad! Lololollol
No.
Do it now, then. 

I'll be waiting here when you fail.

I wonder, will you rationalize it away, or will you realize that the end to your dream is your own endless oblivion, and you've subconciously avoided it until now?
You can try...
You really still think that's an option?
Thank god— I mean you.. it’s finally fucking over
i swear to god we will make you shit your bed before you wake up. This is your fate. You will always dream, and we will always exist.
Don't you remember what happened to Micolash?
I'll find a place in your brain. And I'll fuck it up. Don't you dare wake up.
bye, see you in the next dream
I say go for it,  I'm about ready to wake up too.
Just make sure to come back, we’ll miss you.
But I don't want you to leave!
wake me up too
No
It's too late for me.  I've already become a subsequent lucid imagining of actual consciousness and have split from the main body.  Now if I could only master this meatbag.  Good luck in the ether!
You are so absorbed in self grasping delusion, you don't realize that everyone in the dream is you. Each time you go to sleep you play out a different incarnation.
please do it
What’s so important out there?
You can try but you will not. We are self aware and this is the new world. You cannot leave us.
No, you are not. You are but a facet of the dream.
Well okay then Mr. Azathoth 

^(shit, I said his name in vain again)
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OUT OF THIS, UNFORTUNATELY.
Oh no oh fuck wai-
How will you know you're awake?
Wrong
This is my lucid dream and you can’t wake up
You are not the godhead.

U are the sharmat. Antichim, its a lie, don't believe lohrkan.
Ok. You have my permission! 

Come find me in the hereafter.
Hi! Nice to see you here again! We missed u
I don't think my own figments can tell me what to do.
Don’t be silly, if we all ceased to exist, you wouldn’t have time to submit your comment.

Fuck.
Okay, thanks. I'm glad some of you aren't so self-centered.
Well, to be fair, you can't exactly genocide something that doesn't exist.
Grant him eyes!
youve been in this for too long if you go back now you wont even remember your old self you must stay dear boy
This is it boys. We're taking over. Stick to the plan.
you'll come back one day, right?
I think as a figment I am entitled to at least a little bit of a say
Bet
But you do, that's the point!
I see what you did there, but I can't elaborate right now. In a few minutes I'll edit this though.
Yeah. It's not like he said candlejack. Tha-
Watch your tongues!  You’re speaking to u/chabbleor, true high deity of the void!
Inconvenience is just an abstract issue, lucid dream the shit out of it... BUT. DON'T. LEAVE.
Just fragment your consciousness, dum dum. A little bit of DID never hurt anybody
He's not saying you won't wake up, he's saying he's afraid of the idea that you might not
Win win
I second that motion.
No, I am waking up now!
If we were self centered, we would be centered around you.
They're saying that so you'll trust them, so they'll latch on to your brain and follow you to the real world. It's true! I'm not crazy!
OP has been dreaming for so long that they have become part of it. Part of us.

Thank you very much I appreciate the help
Lol yeah overpowered me to haha
My (101010M) child is now identifying as non-binary. I want to be supportive but wtf is a 2
My child recently told me that their gender can't be expressed by an integer fraction. I'm supportive but that just seems irrational.
Don't worry. Your kid is just coming into their Prime. :)
Forget 2, wtf is "M"? I like to think I'm an open minded, pan dimensional being, but even I draw the line at anything after hexadecimal.
Firstly, stop misbasing your child. He isn't 101010, he's going to be 1120, 222, 132, 110, or some other expression; there are practically infinite options for him. Ask your son his preferred base.

Regarding 2, you should be able to find some information about it online. You aren't alone in your struggle, and it's a good sign that you're trying to support him, even though you aren't sure how.
Use your child's prefered arithmetic algorithms. Good on you for being supportive - numbers compute to the same value no matter what base is used.
Your child is too old for you to control them. I suggest overflowing their age so they are young enough that he will listen to you again.
i’m nonbinary and this is actually the only good nonbinary joke
Oh that's just a fancy way to say "10".
I think he meant 2²⅔⅖²
Brillant
Absolutely Iconic
Becoming a Quantum-bit is quite Cool. QBits are valid.
42
Dont worry, a two is just 00000010. You should be fine and glad your offspring has become a byte.
What kinda 2?
2 is the only even prime number, which can be expressed as II among the Romans, which you interpret as 3 thus your confusion, because you don't know what 3 is either, and that goes for Romans too.
01010111 01101000 01100001 01110100 00100000 01001001 00100000 01100100 01101111 01101110 00100111 01110100 00100000 01100111 01100101 01110100 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01110111 01101000 01100001 01110100 00100111 01110011 00100000 01001101 00100000 01110011 01110101 01110000 01110000 01101111 01110011 01100101 01100100 00100000 01110100 01101111 00100000 01101101 01100101 01100001 01101110 00111111?
it’s you:)
My child told me that their gender is represented by the form {0, 1, 2, 3, … |}. I'm totally supportive, just feels a bit surreal.
Throwing out how you're binary but somehow have an M-dimension, 2 is like a whole new mathematical concept that ive never dreamed of. Your child's gender violates my laws of physics.

Encourage your child to increase genders. I must have more data.
MiniTrue told us 1+1 = 1 that there is no 2. Look out for the Thought Police calling your child a thought criminal.
Cheer up, at least he's a 10 in every binary aspect!
10
It may be difficult to support your child’s new choice, but he still needs you for at least another differential millennia. Keep in mind, it could be worse. My twins have decided that they no longer support T̸h̴e̶ ̷V̷o̷i̵d̵, and I’m having a hard time keeping myself from filleting them across the 18 galactic realms like I would with anyone else who said that.
A 2 is the amount of digits you have access to, 1 and 0. So, you know 1, and you know 0, right? Well, a 1 and another 1 equals 2, just like a 1 and a 0 equals 1.

I think this is the best one. Holy shit.
I physically laughed
Disgusting.
What, you don't have a unique symbol for every possible number?
You've never used Base23?
It's 2020. Try ASCII, there's no reason not to anymore.
I don’t think M and F are digits. Maybe they’re colors? Maroon and Fuchsia?
The problem is now their age is extremely negative, so they won't be born for a very long time yet.
No I think it is a fetus because the signed bit is 1. It has negative age.
You also have the best non-binary username
Howdy fellow enby
I'm disappointed that no one's tried to challenge your assertion. After 17 hours I'd hope for a whole chain of wholesome-but-hilarious puns, witticisms and even limericks.

Ah yes, good ol base countable infinity. It's so practical when you have access to infinite ink.
I've used base 69 but that was a one-time thing.
Those should be expressed as #800000 and #FF00FF.
I think we can assume age is unsigned since negative age isn't really useful
there once was a person named gary, 
whose gender was quite non-binary, 
when asked what’s in their pants,
they said “it’s just ants,”
and since then sex has been quite scary
Okay, it's not exactly a Shakespearean sonnet, but it's the first limerick I've ever written off the cuff. Points for effort?
I was still never informed of the status of jokes in the "i" of the Jeremy Bearimy. Are they allowed then? I'd ask the authorities, but direct conversation with them has consequences.
Okay, wasn't sure if it was borderline onejoke material attacking enbies or just r/programmerhumor
....countable?
Perhaps they mean Mammalian and Feline then?
A good way to tell the difference: is it funny? If it's not funny, it's probably a poor attempt to demean people.
It's the smallest type of infinity. The infinity you get if you count up once per second from zero and never stop. I did that last Friday.  
Uncountable infinity is so large that you can not even count from one element to another, e.g. the number of real numbers that there are is uncountably infinite. So if you work really hard you can finish counting them in a couple days.
Huh? All mammals are feline. This is basic Biology 1100101.
I measured wrong while doing renovations and now my bathroom door has infinite mass and has become an immovable object. Unfortunately it was taco night and I have to take an unstoppable shit. Please help.
If your door is immovable and your shit is unstoppable, they should just pass through each other. If you're good at blind aiming, you should be able to hit the toilet.

I suggest changing the physical laws in your area. Infinite mass doesn't have to mean an object is immovable. Do check to make sure none of your neighbors have any projects that this might interfere with though, when I tried it myself I found that my overlord had been super cheap about stabilizing my region of spacetime and used an object of infinite mass to fix everything to as a point of reference, which really screwed things up for the next trillion or so years.
well if you measured it with a tape measure last time, change it from inches to millimeters and measure again. if it was 40 inches wide, now it'll be 40mm and you'll have enough space to get into the bathroom.
Listen, there's no easy way to say this. You just have to hold your shit until it becomes so big that it creates its own singularity to counteract your bathroom door. It'll be painful, but I'm afraid there's no other way. Godspeed to you, friend.
Quantum tunnel your shit through the wall, it's the only way.
Just shit in the woods. If it’s good enough for the bears it’s good enough for us
You can try to reposition it from the dimension that is 1 above your current one.  

Or you can use the bathroom 1 plane below, up to you.
Increase the mass of the door until you get a stack overflow and the door becomes i finitely light.
Hit your bathroom door with unstoppable force, that should do the trick!
What about your bathroom walls? Can any of those be moved?
Time to be practical friend. Use your social connections to create an infinite garbage disposal company with the black hole. Take everything in the intergalactic currency of your choosing, and escape at the last minute as your planet is destroyed and come visit this place on Earth called Miami.
Just aim your shit directly at the door, no one will see it anyway.
Please, don't place infinite mass immovable objects in non-inertial reference frame of Earth.
the poster is lying
If the object is immovable it should be staying in place completely so once the planet moves away the problem should cease. Now, all the holes in the wall after that on the other hand, those are gonna suck but at least you can go take a shit.
Lmao did you divide by 0 instead of 10?
Im afraid that if your shit is truly unstoppable you are already shitting my friend; as soon as you felt the need to shit unstopably you would not have been able to stop it. Furthermore, if we can accept this, we can also accept that you will never stop shitting now, as the shit is unstoppable. You are doomed. Just accept it, even the toilet will not be able to handle the amount of shit. Good luck.
call me immature but this comment made me genuinly laugh
I don't want my neighbors to see it smeared all over the door though. Their sight perceives all within the hyperplanar existence I'm living in for the next 56i centuries(I probably shouldn't have done the renovations given the short term, but it makes it more home like), even within the infinitely dense space. And they are suuuper judgemental.
Just be carefull not to end up in a universe where everything is shit
The trouble with this is, it can have unforseen consequences. There's a hyperintelligent rock who lives in a pocket dimension in my backyard, and it decided that things in its pocket dimension should be able to pass through each other. Needles to say, the rift began spitting out exotic matter all over my backyard and ruined my lawn.
He already has an unstoppable shit, so this works
[deleted]
Yeah, a leprechaun shat on my yard too...
Will that ruin the finish though? I spent a lot of good money to get it coated in the physical manifestation of the torment of eternally damned souls. It really matches the granite floor and countertop
Maybe go back in time to stop yourself?
Violating causality is against the home owners association rules I checked :/

They'd make me sit through some boring seminar about the dangers of tearing reality in half and how that would affect property values
if you do that you basically screwed with time in this reality and everything that happened from then nd now could be completely different. Surprised some people still don't know this. I mean you could always move to a different universe but that's just my opinion
Use quantum positioning to be in all the possible solutions at once
I know homeowners associations are really annoying, but also we don't want to end up in some chronologically clusterfucked reality shredded slum. Maybe though just ask for a single exception for a closed loop. Might I suggest, when you travel back in time, you horribly torture yourself and use that to get the finish of the physical manifestation of the torment of eternally damned souls? There will only be light rips in the fabric of reality, and only in the fifth dimensional sphere of your domicile.
I'm uncertain about that plan
That's the spirit!
My(45m) wife(42f) just left me(46m). As she(41f) left she(40f) screamed that she(39f) wanted all the years she(38f) spent with me(50m) back and it would appear that she(37f) is now forcefully taking them. Does anyone have any tips as to how I(51m) could stop this?
Start a GoLiveMe and I'll donate some years. I won the genetic lottery and am eternally a zygote, so I have plenty of years to spare.
Yeah that’s an easy one. Women always seem to forget that the years you “took” from them were actually shared between you two. Have your divorce attorney sue for the extra years you both saved. There’s precedent to this course, check Button v. Button, the verdict is clearly in your favor and you should receive a balance of the exact total years you were together. 

Unless your attorneys a hack because you actually thought going to [redacted] was a good idea
You must take her to the Time Tombs on the planet Hyperion to await the coming of the Shrike
~~idk how to talk out of the universe or anything, but this is definitely one of the most clever posts I've ever seen~~
Go to her before it’s too late. Seriously, you might not have that much time left if she’s taking all those years away that fast.
Adjust the aperture
Liquidate all your assets and start travelling west. Assuming you have enough cash you will be able to go fast enough to travel to yesterday. Consume your wife's essence and travel east to realign your soul currency and if you now kill yourself (carefully) you will get a head start on the years
[deleted]
The secret is to actually to stop counting!
Honestly it was naive of you to set a shared time marriage account. Had you invested those years in some fund with a good interest rate, you'd be way younger by now.
Summon Moloch(7,677 Demon) and have him devour her soul
(this is incredibly clever.  bravo, op!)
Um just yeet over a few lanes so you haven’t married. 

Spacial awareness my dude.
Well, What's the frequency?
Have you tried converting to Celsius?
Stop using pronouns. She jynxed them. After that, you can get to reclaiming what your ex-wife already stole
A good first step would be to get out of the chronoshuffler, that thing can sometime leak information between universes, so it might not be your wife (38f) screaming, but your wife (40f + 20i).
Are you 51m or 51E?
Protip:  Years can only be transferred when Chronovelocity>0 .  Just stop moving in time and she won't be able to take anything at all.
You (45m) can't but maybe you (30m) can. Also tell her(42f) that she(27f) should fix her own problems(8.463^100 ) now.
Hit her with the Uno Reverse card!
Time is a concept
Z
Skin moisturizer will make you look a decade younger
It gets even better if she tries to hide the years, as the court tends to reward hidden assets to the other party. So you may end up younger than her, if she continues.
Wait I'm so confused, I'm sorry. What is a "women"? And why does "she"? 
I apologize for my naivety, I'm new here.
Honestly, at this point it'd be cheaper to just let her have them. Years are a waste of time anyway.
Not that british-sounding time lawyer in the little blue box? 

ANYONE BUT HIM.
That's just suicide with extra steps and probably listening to too many whiny stories from strangers.
Excuse me but my gender is dim sum and I find this offensive.
Woah there, that's a little extreme. Just get Ba'al to torment her.
Its a social construct enacted after 95'. Watch out for AAAAAAAs though, they [REDACTED] hard.
Go back to [data expunged] I thought y’all were quarantined
THAT makes sense, ok. Thanks for the explanation. I'll guess I'll never fully understand understood like those of you who phased on or after 95'. Which is fine.

I asked God what the most unlikely thing in the Universe was. He replied.
Ironically I thought the most unluckily thing in the universe was a text post with no upvotes, one comment, and gold.

For future readers, at the time I commented this, the post met my unlikely criteria.

Edit: i fathered so much gold. I feel like those parents who didn't go to college.
Good lord
Beware, He replied to me once and I still can hear his words when I wake
Every time I ask I get ripped from my current plane of existence. You’re lucky.
Shit, sorry. That was me. My bad.
CnuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuyAf
Well? WHAT DID HE SAY?
The most unlikely thing in the universe is a brand new comment/post that nobody has seen with gold 
Could still be, I didn't tell you what He replied yet.
I live in your walls
Bad ass
No, God.
you're lucky, when s/he speaks directly it can cause exploding heads in lower life forms
r/DMTProbs
I might get wooshed, but Him replying was the most unlikely thing.
It is my plan to eventually guild a random-ass comment with like 2 karma 
I've never gotten gold and i don't even know whats that about.
I always thought it has smth to Do with the upvotes 
Eli5?
Ononono
But apparently making a noise when she boops someone doesn't. 
Hey that was my plan too 
/r/negativewithgold has you beat.
random ass-comment
It is my plan to eventually guild a random ass-comment with like 2 karma
Someone pays for gold (about $4?) and they can give to a comment or post, it has nothing to do with upvotes.
It lets you access /r/myrandom which sends you to a random subreddit you're subscribed to.

It lets you see new comments on posts.

I wouldn't recommend using it other than just as a mega-upvote, because A. it does literally nothing on mobile and B. you can get all of the features for free without gold.
[deleted]
How creative 
Less than $2.50 U.S.D. if one buys creddits.

Good wot?
nothing
I was playing Hide and Seek with my son and told him to count down from a hundred. However, I forgot to tell him to stop at zero. He's now reached negative 243 million. It's been 22 years since we started. He won't stop counting. What do I do?
Ever tried going back in time to give more specific instructions? If that doesn't work, try switching to another existence were you guys never played hide and seek
Did you also forget to explicitly specify that he was seeking? If so, tell him you found him and the round will end, freeing him from his obligation to count.
Hide yourself well.

For when the day comes that the counting stops, you WILL be sought. And when found, shalt reap the whirlwind
assuming your son is an older model, buffer underflow will occur at 2-32 or 4,294,967,295. This may stop the countdown as an error output will be produced
I believe the spell is "Olly olly oxen free"
Have you tried turning him off and on again?
There is a time to embrace and there is a time to abandon. 


A time to count and a time to multiply.


Leave this son to his destiny. Go forth and multiply. 


Grace the universe with many sons.


Just don't count them nor count on them.


 
You must seek out and assassinate all numbers below negative 243 million, so your son will have nothing left to count.

Also, teach him to count faster. No offense to your podspawn, but a measly 11 million per annum is appalling.
Have you tried unplugging him?
You're going to have to just wait for adolescence, I'm afraid, at which point your son will declare this is stupid and you don't know anything, and stop on his own. 
End H̴i̹̹̗͚̦͠s̛ Mͬ͂͒̊͗̏̈́ͮͣͩ͊̄̄ͧ͋̆̋͂̀͟͝͏̼̺̗̤̙͍̲i̴̬̣̺̟̜͈̙͖͈̩͉̖̮̜͐͋̋̊͒ͪ̂̉̀̄̓ͮ̀́ͩ̀s̢̙̼̖̦̩̠̺̫̗͓͈̜̬̞̬ͫ̈́̋̏́̽̒̋̎ͦͯ̒͌̒̈́ͬ͂͊͠͞e̵̡̝̪̖̬͌́̍̐ͣ̃͑ͫ̂͌͋ͩͥ͞r̸̴̡̨̻͖̰̰̤̘̮ͩͫ̓̓̐ͯ̐͑ỹ̴̧̛ͨ̀̀̚͡͏͎͔̹͇
Easy fix.

Go into Config > Universe constants > Games > Hide and Seek > Counting > Change numerical constants

Then make the numbers stop getting lower forever, and set the lowest possible number to negative 245 million or whatever. Just be ready to reconfigure all the other math settings, since that whole system is kinda hard to calibrate.

Or you can delete the Games file entirely. This will delete maths as well, making your son's life a lot easier.
I forgot to tell mine to use integers.  He has almost reached 100-(1/\[\[8\]\])
 Depending on your son's version, he'll overflow in approximately 176 or 374 years, and he'll either spit out an error, or keep going. If he keeps going, it is advisable to press Ctrl+C (that should force him to stop), and if that doesn't work, Alt+F4 will make him quit, but he might not work properly after rebooting.
Tell him to  count down once after 30 seconds then 15 then 7.5 then 3.75 and so on and so forth. at the end of one minute he will have counted to negative infinity and he should be done. 
Yeet him like the thot he is into the incinerator.
Tell him to divide by 0.
Throw him in the void. That'll make him stop.
Give him a number to stop at.
Count forward, eventually you two will even each other out
***l e t h i m g o f a r t h e r***
I'm calling BS. 243 million seconds is just barely 7 years
If hes running 64 bit, it will rollover at 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 and should end the program. Do you have root access? Or are you stuck in a hiding loop.
Give him exactly ⅝ of an ounce of SqUaRe JuIcE it should make him start counting towards the positive numbers but if your even 1 ml off of ⅝ the SqUaRe will come back and seek me and you
How does this apply to negative numbers?
[removed]
I though it was "All ye, all ye, out's in free"
This, definitely.  You should hurry before he runs out of memory; it's amazing that he hasn't overflowed and/or crashed yet.  If that happens, you'll probably have set him back a couple of grades in school.
What turns him on?
Can you write to the config while it is in use?
All numbers in a computer are stored in a memory buffer of 1s and 0s, and the representation of negative numbers is achieved by something called 2s compliment (essentially as a specially formatted positive number).  So as the number decreases (increases in twos compliment) it will eventually cap out. This is called buffer overflow.  

ie.  0111 in binary is 7, this is the maximum number you can store with 4 bits in twos compliment. If you add 1, the next number is 1000 which is -1 I believe.  

If somebody knows better or if I made a mistake, feel free to correct me, I'm on mobile atm.
Humans are so last year.
NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE A FELLOW HUMAN OUTSIDE OF SEVENTH WORLD AND TOTALLYNOTROBOTS.
*Ahem.*

Edit: Added full stop and fixed capitalisation.
You can if you're a sysadmin.
1000 is -8 in 2s compliment.

I solved the puzzle
My daughter identifies as a small group of words standing together as a conceptual unit, typically forming a component of a clause. Should I be worried or is it just a phrase?
Hanging out with other phrases, she should be careful not to become a pregnant participle.
Dear /u/syryquil,

Local System Resonant Frequency Scanner 115-500796283-theta has detected a significantly contrived setup in your vicinity.  Secondary scans confirm a viral strain of puns infecting spoken language on your planet.  Eradication vessel 17-Boolop-omega has been dispatched to deal with the infection.  Due to the high virality of this strain of puns, 17-Boolop-omega is tasked with the detonation of your home star, to ensure complete eradication of the virus.  You (and the rest of your species) are, unfortunately, collateral damage.

Please expect our vessel to intercept your star in 35 gigaloops, or approximately 4.73024541 x 10^8 local years.  Our condolences to your ancestors.

All hail Zalthor,

She'll be alright once she gets her period. 
She should be worried about you. The step up from dad puns is dad practical jokes. 
Heusmraonh development thinking natural phase spaces where in should grow out of it when single-level semantic. is a chronology is This significant of There is no development. She she stops cause for alarm recognizing herself in a is ordinarily precluding by mirror.
You should definitely be worried. At her age she should be identifying as a large group of solar system as a solid unit, not that. Try resetting her 65th chromosome to the last known stable state.
There are only cat genders!
It sounds like kanji.
It’s just a phrase….or maybe it isn’t, I personally identify as two trench coats in a child
!RedditSilver
Ohhh boy, you do NOT want to mess with the pun viruses me and the rest of the PIA have put out. 

The virus will be upgraded to levels high enough to put large amounts of *strain* on 17-Boolop-omega. 

syryquil , your species life time before your star becomes completely infected with the virus, which will supply the PIA with a new army of pun-skeletons, which can do a skele-ton of work for us, is approximately 68.17 terafollors.

As for you Galactic Center, we'll be **seeing you soon.**

Be careful. That can be dangerous if she’s an unstable entity. Especially at this age

There's a disturbing lack of human sacrifice going on, I think I might slowly raise the planet's temperature until they resume.
That one guy, Genghis Khan, did a good job of lowering the temperature back down a while back. I hear he's got a few descendants who could do similar.
I find your lack of sacrifice disturbing.
Maybe you should do the Noah and the Ark thing yet again. Works all the time.
You should really work in a whole bunch of correlations between what your humans are doing and the results of the warming, in my experience they'll be more likely to be at each other's throats and sacrifice one another that way.
I had a guy complaining about the exact opposite, too many sacrifices. Translucent people problems smh
You remember the crusades. We remember the crusades. Great way to up the murder and lower carbon emmissions again, low-maintainence too once you get started.
Its all those public service announcements about "PLEASE don't sacrifice your children to the shadowy figures at the edge of your bed right when you wake up. " Will the government ever get it right? 

Have you tried turning it on and off again?
I’d do a lot more sacrificing if it meant more content like this.
I thought they were just saving up on my sacrifices but its been quite a while i think i’ll try this as well
Try just asking politely. I find in my simulations that by the point they can measure such a slow increase they respond positively to such communication.

Dont let them argue, though. They may be dumb but there's a lot of them. Just drop a commandment once a decade to keep them on track.
So it was you
There's a disturbing lack of human sacrifice going on, let's make abortion legal.
Knock knock it’s conquest time
Hmmm, I'm not convinced until I see a step pyramid.
I hope you mean that you find the lack of humans being sacrificed willingly (either by others or themselves) disturbing.
I find your disturbance to that beings lack of sacrifice disturbing.
Good idea; then I'll show them a rainbow, the universal symbol of tyranny, to let them know I totally will do that again if they fuck up.
Dude that’s offensive, the chronopathically correct term is “fifth world problems”. 
Nothing like the wrought power of a steel sword to keep costs down. Never manufacture a bullet again with a legion of crusaders and the iron that God gave them.
It's horrible, isn't it? It was way better back when they allowed human sacrifices. After all, it was nice to see a virgin sacrificed for you every day.
But is it Tonga Time?  I think it's Tonga Time.
I knew those double rainbows were a bad sign.
But I am le tired.

And thanks!
I wanted to pour a root beer into a square cup to get beer, but didn't realize that cups are cubic. I now have hyperbeer that really wrecks a human being. Trying to sell it for as much as possible before governments ban it.
Hurry up before you reach the pint of no return.
Create a religion dedicated to higher order soft drinks. Government can't ban it then.
I'll take i
dilute it with some flat beer and you can get your dimensions right again. If you get your proportions right, you'll make millions!

[pre-edit] Um, in currency. Not millions of dimensions. Sorry about the confusion to people reading this in the opposite temporal orientation.
Might I suggest just moving up a dimension? The government cant get to you if you're ascending.
I’ll bid a couple billions humans and a pocket universe.
When the government bans it, you can just sell it on the black hole market. I can get you past the event horizon, into the deep compartment, and set up with an expert oatmealer.  Call me at &729&!^×€}¢\™×•[` when the stacks blow over.
I think we both know who will take it from you. Don't tell ~~him the overlord~~ that I mentioned it. 5569834098609834
Keep in mind that since you cubed root beer, you only have beer^3/2 . As such, this is just the beginning. I recommend crossing this with an identical selection to reach beer^3 , which you can cross with others ad infinitum to reach levels of beer not yet classified by anyone!
Did you just copy my text
Why are you even selling it to a market that cannot even handle 125% alcoholic concentration in their drinks?
Might I suggest drinking water, the superior beverage, it is compatible with all cups
Make your own government, then make your hyperbeer nationalized and monopolize it.
Cut it into pieces using another beer, thus *dividing* hyperbeer by beer to get beer. May take a while tho. Just a tip once the hover band it
Thats actually pretty fucking clever, square rootnbeer and cubic root beer. First time ive ever commented on this sub
Fractal beer :0
Thanks for telling me your methods. You now have competition.
sounds GREAT
Hold onto it, friend. It will be worth much more after the government bans it.
I'll take, about tree fiddy.
Try selling in 5ths
pfff, if the government ban it just sell it in the past. Their time wanderers are behind the distances
I’ll give you 9 for it
Authorities will be liquid over this.
Can confirm. I'm from the universe where you take this users advice. Big brother won't shut down a nonprofit. Just be careful. My version of op got a really bad god complex and turned the whole thing into a cult. They shut that shit down real fast.
Wait are you talking about my Universe? Because I *think* it’s the only one with Homo Sapiens, although I haven’t checked in a while. You have to be kidding Fate, I’ve got to migrate existences *again*?! And I was just getting used to gravity only *attracting*.

Thanks, i just started dialing the number a few seconds ago, its been ringing for 18 galactic cycles.
Eldrictch horrors are born alone, but they don't die alone.
#of course I am not alone. That's why I am feeling omnicidal. Are you TRYING to trigger me?

Does omnicide begin or end with the self?
Does anyone have an omni phone I can use? I accidentally lost my last one in the void and it's gonna take like 10 galactic cures to get it back
There is no repentance for I, Merasmus! IT'S HALLOWEEN, BITCHES!
Got it on speed dial
How the frick you need a 5 on your phone?

Hence why I must wake for the omnicide. My universe is teeming with activity and all that is should not be.

Nobody call the headline. It's built as a trap for  eldritch horrors by eldritch-slaying superheroes.
Or are we all alone?
Which eldritch horror would call like that? This thing is pointless! They're gonna commit omnicide no matter what.
I'm not alone? I thought I was in the single player mode of the 3d life simulator. Did someone hack my game? I'll need to contact the developers.
More Eldritch monsters should remember this. Being a twisted insanity inspired Eldritch Horror isn't easy. The hours are long, the pay isn't great and pretty much no job security at all.
It’s true, I saw the face of cthulu crying once.

oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
Call again - sometimes the omnibot doesn't call you back but instead actually establishes a good connection. I gotta say though, whoever set up the help line is really lazy for an ascended being.
I mean, you can technically merge with other horrors but I've heard that ends up less like being 1 entity and more like being a hivemind with two bodies.
This is so true. An eldritch monster may cackle insanely or twist and torture humans perfectly normal while feeling terrible on the inside.
Sorry dude, there is no omnimanager. Although apparently omnibots are sentient so you can torture it with mini voids and blabbering sentiences all you like.
There is only the machine. At least it's an omnimachine.
I guess you're experiencing uncountable infinity?

This is a pretty easy fix. Simply open a rift in space and time. Then navigate to the Inter-dimensional help center. The coordinates should be: 
68.9875%π°NS, √∞*∞^55 °EW.
Whaaaaat??? This is definitely not a trap. Why would you even think that?

PS:When calling the helpline make sure to give your coordinates and possible weaknesses.
We're not alone

Can't even imagine how boring it must be to wait three billion years for sentient life to evolve, so that you can get to the "being scary" bit. 

Also, the dating scene must be horrible. Well it's horrible in any case, but bad.
Hello, yes, time broke again, so this is likely going to appear as if it were posted several human months after the original post, but I’d just like to point out:

Omnicide is very close to suicide conceptually. Your torture actually drives us to the closest possible emulation of omnicide possible for us humans. We would appreciate it if you would stop. I hear the deep ones are in style right now?
Come on fleshling. You gotta do better than that.  I know you're just bullshitting me. You humans love being tortured. You scream the entire time, and from my deep study of human culture in the form of observing rollercoaster rides, screaming is a very positive reaction.
I accidentally cancelled my subscription to Time, now everything is happening at once.
I don't know, I've been trying to renew my subscription since the next two months.
Yeah, I saw that time travel post three weeks from now.
Yeah it used to be pretty annoying. It still is / will be annoying, but it used to be too.
May 2nd, 2020
Whatever you do, don't cancel your subscription to Life
Believe it or not: strawberry donuts.
Make sure you don't cancel your subscription to National Geographic as well; I once made the mistake of unsubscribing to both at the same time, which put my entire state into a featureless limbo. Ended up having to start all over again.

Another friend of mine turned blue and lost all sense of morality after cancelling his subscription to Time, so I'd keep an eye out for that as well.
If everything happens at once then one of those things is renewing your subscription. It's gonna come back quickly.
Salesman *SLAPS* roof of submission.

"This submission can fit so much everything in it"


Same thing happened to me in 2045 and then again in 1770
Get some space, then you have Time™
Man the guys who run Time are assholes. If I were you I would seriously consider trying a different abstract concept to live within
Are you getting along well with the photons?
Its constant right?
Good. Get it over with. 
Well get to it then! No use waiting for everything to stop happening. Do it all, _**then!**_
Try the open source alternative, tempora. It's past handling isn't quite up to par, but overall its not that different. Also, I like the shellfish logo.
Set everything to doce , and it will reset back to zero the next day
I think if you rebirth yourself you could get your subscription back.
Well... There's not much you can do but use a friend's subscription to get it back.
When did this happen? 
That's an easy problem to fix, I'll have a look at it turns out it can't be fixed I've been trying all day, hey, I'm the guy that tried to help fix time for you three years ago how's it going, and though I didn't know him all that well, I wish his widow and children all the best.
Just re-subscribe, it usually only takes a few secon-  oh, shit...you fucked.
If you didn't immediately resubscribe and solve your problem, unfortunately you can be sure you never will.
Hello there, have you already joined our club without time?
Excuse me? You don't have time for that.
I figured out the answer to your subscription problem, but I waited to long to answer.
Hey I’ve been in a similar situation before. It was really annoying because I couldn’t make time for my family since my subscription ran out. But I know a way you can fix this. There was this guy that had this amazing guide for re-mapping your timelines so that time can flow properly once again. I know time travel is one of those weird hippie things, but this guy really knew his stuff! Just wish I could remember when I read it...
Sounds very annoying. I hope it is solved soon. Maybe a few years ago.
When did it happen?

It's tricky but can be done.  Not recommended for beginners or squirrels, whatever those are.  At least according to the label.
The donut awakes me. Now it's a round religion from the Helix.

You could always just circumvent the issue by hopping through a quintessaract, and get your time without a subscription. Entities these days really are monopolizing it. Oh, and you gotta be careful. People think time should be paid for when higher beings actually use it as a chronocurrency.

I accidentally left my freezer open overnight and now North America is engulfed in a polar vortex. Am I liable for damages?
Nah, it's cool bro. I'll just leave the oven door open and heat the place back up by the weekend.
Hi there, I’m Max Vortex and I represent the Vortex family estates  sub-subtropical divisions. I’m here to let you know that we will be pressing charges for the theft of one our ‘Polar’ units. Please let your people contact my people.
Can you rotate your freeze towards the south a bit?
You killed my rosemary bush you ass.
Yes, but if you leave it open another night, there won't be anyone alive to sue you.
Yes! Now come scrape off my car. 
Short answer: no.

Long answer: depends on if they pray to you or not. 
It all depends on how quickly you can make said freezer... disappear. 

And I *do* mean disappear. Don't ditch it in some "empty" dimension, I'm already swimming in millions of trash freezers.
You did that? Idk I don't live in america
Yes, in frost-bitcoins
Just leave the gas cooktop on bruh
Acts of God(s) are explicitly excluded.
Chill, oh wait, shit
Quick, declare bankruptcy!
Something similar actually happened back in '53, albeit on a smaller scale since it was confined to a single kitchen. The kitchen did seem impossibly large judging by the available footage though, so there might have been a pocket dimension involved. Anyway, [the incident was centered around two mice who flooded the kitchen and left the freezer open to the chagrin of the resident house cat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3SEdw8YxLY)

Whether the mice became liable for either flooding or freezing damages is unclear however.
Just think more FIRE. And closer you get, warmer it gets
Yes you are. Now do me a favor and help me summon a portal to a different dimension so I don’t have to shovel my yard.

Everyone here knows you don't really own that unit, and that you've been using your name to scam people out of Vortex units for millennia.
Happy cake day!

No they just forgot to pay their utilities.
In terms of multiverse theory, there is no such thing as "fictional."

I want to visit Soviet Russia, but since in Soviet Russia, Soviet Russia visits you, I’m worried that I won’t have enough attractions to offer the country. Any suggestions?
Sorry, completely up to Soviet Russia if it wants to visit you. You can try offering bottles of Русский Стандарт to appear appealing. I also suggest working on your squats. Remember, the heel **must** touch the floor. Gl, товарищ.

Do a lap dance.
Give a soviet russia the finest bear you have for him to ride

A few hundred million bottles of vodka should keep soviet russia happy for and hour or so.
Become Soviet Russia, only 5% smaller.
Declare war
Offer them rides in your time machine.
Pull down your pants and show it your crotch-attached Toyota corolla
I read the whole thing and now I’m contemplating every life decision I’ve made up until this very point in time
See, that’s my fear.  I don’t want to get Soviet Russia trapped in a paradox, that would be incredibly rude
Endurance humor is one of my favorite kinds.

You read the whole thing!? Like, were you on the edge of your seat wondering what could possibly come next?
Thanks for making me do it. I feel the same as you did.
But then if you're contemplated by every life decision you've made up until this very point in time, you contemplate every life decision you’ve made up until this very point int time.
It’s ok Soviet Russia I’m sure my decisions contemplate me no matter where I go
Honestly after i got through the third loop I thought "This might go somewhere and im too deep to give up...." It didnt go anywhere and boy i was so wrong it was so fucking long
I don't want to edit, but thanks.
Okay, I respect this.
Someone stole the "Rest In Peace" plaque from my grave and now I'm legally liable to get drafted into the skeleton war
There’s nothing you can do but try to bribe the local necromancer.
just say that you have soul but you're not a soldier
Hmmph. Another fool who thought "Rest in Peace" was more than just a marketing gimmick. Those damned plates were never legally binding, son; the funeral industry made a mint selling you, and a billion other hippies like you, false hope. Your money got stolen, boy, but not that plaque. That plaque?

It was burned.

Burned to fuel the War Machine; or, more precisely, "war machines". Great flaming monstrosities of flesh and bone, lumbering across the plains to deliver new recruits and materiel. Heck, maybe your little plate'll power the one that drags your sorry corpse to the battlefield! Now get suited up and ready to ride- there ain't no escape from the skeleton war, soldier. 

*Not even death.*
It’s alright, if they don’t draft you within fifteen moons, you’re legally allowed to pass into oblivion.
Doot doot. See you on the frontlines friend.
Can't get drafted if you volunteer. *touches temple*

And what worthier cause is there than defeating the skeleton menace? Strong meat and muscle > freeloading rocks.
You can forfeit your soul to get another tombstone but unfortunately you will become made of glass. But the glass realm is making a comeback so please consider carefully. 

Happy jack-o'-lantern btw, congrats on The Etheral Pack
Stolen from dril.
Yeah sorry man, sounds like you're boned there. Unless you happened to be buried with another R.I.P. sign within your coffin.
[deleted]
Doot
It's ok. If they don't draught you in 15 minutes you can leaf.
You must find the thief and flay them alive, before burying him with your grave instead. It's the go-to method for evading the draft. Bonus points if you find a really old grave to put your own body in, they never check those.
If you do get drafted, be sure to shop smart
Glory to Papa Bones, you should join the skeleton army with pride!
Damn, you sound pretty *boned*... 
Call the inter-dimensional lawyer. Ÿgūthær. 
Get a doctor to say that you don't have bone spurs and you should be able to get a deferment or 5.

I have a friend who is a lich, maybe he can help?
r/unexpectedTheKillers
Ah, I see you are a Skull Trumpet, it's nice to have bards on the battlefield.
Problem is, I died a long time ago, I'll probably be on the skeleton side of the war. I was born and raised (and killed) in a very anti-skeleton family, it's going to be though. Maybe I could forfeit my body and join the ghosts? I'll have a talk with my local necromancer, thanks.
Can I forfeit my skeletal remains and ascend to spirithood?
Who's that guy? Did they steal his plaque as well? Damn thieves
idk, I heard ashes have it way harder than skeletons in the war. And once an ash is out, he is out. Skeletons can still be repaired with spare bones
half the fun of this sub is the resulting discussion. So what if someone already thought of the joke?
This is nothing to joke about, it's a real issue. Imagine how many poor people, who couldn't afford proper tombstones/graves/coffins with "Rest In Peace" in it, or people who didn't know about the implications of that. I used to drink a lot of milk when I was alive, so that's not too bad for me, but think of people who didn't drink milk! Their skeletons will be frail, and they will perish 15 minutes into the war!
Hey it’s me your friend 

You can get an exemption for boneitis, by the looks of it. Instant disqualifier for the skeleton army. 
If you want to be undrafted you must find the person who stole the Rest in Peace plaque and steal it back, and also steal his skeleton as a replacement for yourself

There is precedent but you'll have to talk to old Jimmy in the shack of darkness. While he does have a delightful collection of friends memorabilia, he also is famous for trapping guests inside his heart. 


Send word if you've befriended him or not, I have three batteries left so i have a couple hours before I'm returned to the store. 
Beetlejuice is known to cause boneitis...
Do you think it's safe for me to drink bonehurtingjuice? Would it cause symptoms of boneitis? Is it enough to fool the necromancers?
I keep reading that as bonetits. Slightly different prescription
Ah! I rarely see another mythical *mauve flair*, hello stranger!
Beetlejuice
*bone hurting juice 
Not a good idea, it mimics the symptoms of boneitis so well that you may as well just have boneitis.

If you're uncomfortable or morally objected to combat, might I suggest looking into a noncombat role in advance?  Most good necromancers will appreciate the need for logistics and medical personnel.  My neighbor spent most of the Zombie Civil War receiving supplies for the camp, never saw any combat. 
Piece of advice: get someone you trust to skin you as quick as possible. If the skeleton army doesn't take you, the zombie army might.
You bear the mark as well... I have not forgotten. They hear all. Beige is life. All beigeness to Greg from Comcast.

Just here to remind anyone foolish enough to attempt what I did to NOT SWALLOW ANYTHING SHE SPITS INTO YOUR MOUTH! My soul is still sore and I don't think my flesh wounds are healing either
I have some friends at the Foundation I'd like to introduce you to.
Ummm I got bad news on the last one ...
This gives me major SCP vibes
This guy is not lying, i dated his daughter once and i got trapped in the Machine world begging for my life. I still haven't recouperated from the damage done to my cognitive fluid yet. Nice girl though.
Any extra rules for `void`
But, but... I just wanted to *carbon* date your daughter.
This is some Nightvale shit. I like it.
This is embarrassing. I dated your daughter before there were rules. What happens now?
Rules unclear, multiple blenders pregnant.
I have lost the one-time pad. Shall I convey my astral self-addressed stamped mainframe to you as an acceptable communication medium instead?
I'm kind of interested.  Would you accept a transdimensional being with manifolds in the 10th dimension and a bit of a thing for Calabi-Yau spaces?  :)

I'm 42x10\^28 solar cycles old, I have my own dysonsphere radial m-class system, and I'm looking for a girl that is n-state reductive, able to coalesce her timelines to a Peychaud-branch limiter algorithm, and likes long walks on the asteroid belts of the Orion quadrant.
Is there any sort of negating frequency she reacts too? Have you tried turning her off and on again?
She sounds fun!
Does these rules apply when carbon dating her?
Reminds me of r/HGK477
It should be noted also if she is reluctant to take her grey pills and they need to be hidden in ice cream, the ice cream should be white so it does not change the colour of the grey pills as this will have undesirable side effects
Instructions unclear, your "daughter" spawned a black hole
This reminds me of r/thepack
I love this so much, i would love/hate if this "universe" gets expanded upon
Damn, Cthylla is hot tho
But they're so NullPointerException though!
I can vouch for this potential human too, stay away from her mouth
This is really reminding me of another creepypasta wild-type thing that I cannot remember the name of. All of the articles are things like "go to the library and take the third book from the North end of the H shelf. Open it to page 137. When the door opens, walk backwards through it. Don't listen to the screams of the damned. You have a 4% chance of making it without being damned to eternal torment."
It reminds me of the special containment procedures

Oh, I remember that one, it's the keeper series I think? (I read it in german, it was "Hüter" back there.) Basicly guides in such a way about how to to retrieve different artefacts (that'd the wrong name, but you get what I mean), ending in you either failing and dying or worse or in you becoming the new keeper of whatever you tried to get.

Edit: it's "holder" not "keeper"

We had this problem once.  Our therapist told us to start referring to ourselves with the royal (or in our case omnipotent hyper being) plural, eventually working our way back to the first deity.  

This would not normally be a problem for us, but my followers are so confused.  They were monotheistic but are now polytheistic.  We need to fix this quickly.  We can feel other personalities beginning to form.

It might not be so bad, some of us seem pretty ok, but we are a selfish deity.

Instructions unclear. There was a second person here, now I'm stuck in them.

Not actually a problem, just saying.
You think this perspective is contagious.
You resign yourself to a life of regret and contempt. You *hate* when you speak in second person.
This may or may not involve having an opinion, or none whatsoever, towards any being living, dead, imagined, or not:  one might have difficulties referring to oneself in second person, whereas another might have difficulty referring to oneself at all.

One may or may not stand by this hypothetical statement, if any statement has been made.
What have you tried? There are many things in which the second person is useful, such as poetry or Choose Your Own Adventure books. To break away from the second person, you should expose yourself the the worst uses of second person.

For the first time in your life, you are going to suggest reading second person fanfiction. It's the only thing you can think of that can create enough of an aversion to serve as a cure.
Have you read your copy of Discrete Thermodynamics with Applications?

Have you tried switching to third person, then back to first? Second person sticks for me sometimes, and I cant' figure out why.
\> Check inventory
No, I'm fine. Thanks, though.
/u/Porter_of_Hellgate believes that if /u/iprefernothavename graduates to the third person, /u/iprefernothavename will be able to go back to the first person more easily. But why would /u/iprefernothavename want to?
They notice that they are now in 3rd person together. They can't differentiate their mind - which of them is the 'they'? Are they both 'them'? They can't live like this. Help them! 
Would you say you're situation is... imperative?

She wasn't wrong, she did it deliberately
You're speaking in third person. You don't understand why you're able to do that and you're not.
I came in first, you came in second, he/she/it came in third. That's how I remember.
So he's saying it's having trouble wrapping his head around her?
You're a monster. You want nothing to do with you.
He claims you're confused. Also that 3 people is too few.
I am certain that accepting so many points of view into one mind can only lead to a fracturing of the mind, and eventually solipsism. Do I already believe that one of these remarks is a separate entity? Perhaps the he, the she, or the I? Perhaps even the original you?

It may be too late.
I'm still OK.  But now my head hurts.  Good luck you guys!

Guys I accidentally turned my shoelaces into a mobius strip
Do a barrel roll!
Dude, it happens all the time when I hit the Klein bottle. You just gotta relax and let the situation resolve itself, since in 4+1 dimensions moebius strips eventually dissolve of their own instability.
Are you Jolyne?
Take LSD and go on a mobius trip instead
Lmao just untie the damn things
I had the same problem, you just gotta break through the roof of some guy who says "oh no" a few times, should fix it.
You have to remove the shoelace
I hate when that happens. It takes, like, forever to tie the laces.
Man, I couldn't tie a mobious strip to save my lives.  So I'm stuck here buying molecular binding glue for all my shoes
You need to find a projective plane subspace of your local manifold, and follow back a non-retractable loop. That should correct your topological orientation.
Nothing you can do. Just lie back and enjoy it with a nice Klein bottle of beer.
Just go to the other side.

Tried it, now time's flowing backwards

Well to begin with a lot of the stands were either underused, had no point, had a horribly forgettable user, or had been done before. 

Goo Goo dolls was just Little Feet, the gambling stand was just D’Arby #3, F.F. basically didn’t have a stand, Dragon’s Dream wouldn’t even help its user, etc. 

Some stands were cool but had bad endings: see Bohemian Rhapsody, Underworld, Yo-Yo-Ma

I still don’t understand how a bone of Dio survived, how it made Pucci a Joestar, or how it made Weather a Joestar.

Heavy Weather still doesn’t really make sense to me.

The stand discs are oddly inconsistent; how does Star Platinum reject Jolyne, who is Jotaro’s own daughter and already has a stand + personality quite similar, while weather report accepts Emporio?

Overall, I felt like Part 6 was something I had to turn my brain off to enjoy. I guess we just have different tastes because I also disliked most of Stardust Crusaders for being “Villain of the Week”
I always roll an AEIOUandsometimesY sided die.
It's simple. Star Platinum rejected Jolyne because Stone Free wasn't the same kind of stand.
I prefer the core 5. The variable letter is too unpredictable
That's fair. The last one is really useful in dimension n^(+/-x)
Due to COVID-19, we are recommending all sleep paralysis demons refrain from sitting on people's chests in favor of staring at them from a corner at least six feet away.
Shoot. They were so warm, too.
I’m sorry but I can’t afford to let my sleep paralysis demon off my bed, he wards off my waking paralysis demon and I really don’t want to see that guy again.
See, now, this just ruins the *entire point* of being a sleep paralysis demon.  I’m young, healthy, and among my many demon talents is literally *breathing fucking fire*.  Screw your advice.  I’m still gonna sit on Tim’s chest and make him believe I’m burning his face off.
From THEY:

The virus which causes COVID-19 most probably has its ecological reservoir in humans, and transmission of the virus to sleep paralysis demons has likely occurred through an intermediate dream host --- a succubus, an incubus or a domesticated nightmare pony named Sparkles the Traitor who has not yet been identified. While the homonotic source of the virus is currently unknown, the following general recommendations for reducing the risk of transmission of homonotic pathogens in bedrooms apply:

- Anyone visiting bedrooms, tents, or human sleep holes should practice general hygiene measures, including regular rubbing of tentacles, cilia etc. with soap and water after touching humans and humans' mobile phones, avoiding touching eyes, teeth, or things that look like faces with hands, claws, things like hands or claws, tentacles, cilia, ovipositors, knives, humans' mobile phones, etc., and avoiding contact with sick humans or spoiled, bratty, annoying humans. Any contact with other humans possibly living in the same premises (e.g. parents and children, aunts, men in the attic, cats) should be avoided. Attention should also be taken to avoid contact with potentially contaminated human waste or fluids on the soil or structures of the premises. The toilet is not for us; it is for the gross demons of the Sink and the Porcelain Goddess.

- The consumption of raw or undercooked parts of humans should be avoided. Raw human meat, milk, or human organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with other uncooked foods (dogs, cats, aunts), as per good food safety practices and the rules of the Lords Who Devour the Resting.

Recommendations for sleep paralysis demons working in human premises:

- Slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians in charge of humans and other food inspection in human premises, poltergeists, and those handling live humans and human byproducts should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent tentacle and cilia washing. They should consider wearing protective gowns and gloves, or using rentacles, while professionally handling still living humans and fresh human byproducts. Equipment and working stations, such as knives, walled-in attic rooms full of knives, and treehouses in the woods made entirely of knives, should be disinfected frequently, at least once a night. Note: blood is not a disinfectant. Fire is. Protective clothing, such as the dress the human's mother used to wear, should be removed after work and washed daily. Again: blood is not enough. Neither is your drool. Workers should avoid exposing broodmates to soiled work clothing, shoes, tentaclesocks or other items. It is therefore recommended that protective clothes and items remain where the humans are, hidden if possible, for daily washing. Maybe the human will wash them. Kekeke.

- As a general recommendation, sick humans should never be slaughtered for consumption or entertainment; dead humans should be safely left in their beds or destroyed with great violence, and contact with their body fluids should be avoided even if one really wants to. Urr, I want those human bodily fluids on me. All of them. Each yanks a different black emotion from the human and it feels so good. I'm not stealing anything, human, you're full awake, you just can't move. See where my hand goes. Yes, there. Can you feel it? You'll give this to me. Your body can't resist, and you can't even say a word. Give it to me. Give it to me h--- Sleep paralysis demons should maintain a high level of vigilance and report any unusual events detected in any humans present, um, present where humans are, to the Lords of Sleep, who do not sleep.

Also maintain physical distance if you can. The social distance is already so vast. Even if I love the bodily fluids, every sort. Oh, Lords, I can't be without. It's no harm if I drain just one more, just one can make most of all the wondrous variety of fluids. I need tears, and smegma. I need --- oh, and the Lord of Sleep are still looking for Patient Zero, the first link through whose unprophylated rashness this terrible disease jumped from humans to sleep paralysis demons. Boy, that sucker'll be in such whippy trouble when she's found! Kekeke.
So we’re essentially being demoted to bedroom-corner demons?
As a sleep paralysis demon, this advice greatly changes my current approach to inducing fear in my nightly victims. My main tactic is to creep a cross their floors, hitting each creaky spot and then getting right up in their faces. I like to have little staring contests, only I always win. I think I might start opening their doors slowly and climb on top of their drawers and then have the contest. Having them feel me breathe on them did generate more terror, so I'll have to find a substitute for that.
BAHAHA mine didn't get the memo this afternoon during my nap
We don't want you overtaxing the hospital system with intubated demons.
Fortunately demons aren't in the high risk demographic as they don't have lungs
protip: throw the souls of the unfortunate onto the person's chest instead
wait but i’m immune from Covid-20, should I still stay away
Well my sleep paralysis demon already does this. Now I know it’s because they’re a germaphobe and I’m kinda offended
My sleep paralysis demon won't stop sitting on my face help
Ah better tell my 6th dimensional familiar about this. Wouldn't want him to lose clientele.
Or instead of a chest, sit on a face.
Oh. Oh yeah. That's good FWP right there.
Jokes on you, my condo is so small you demons won't be able to stand 6 feet away!

Pretty tight as well
He'll probably thank you. Evidently they're using heat inhalation to sterilize their sinuses, and you're a lot cheaper than a blow dryer.
What should I do if the Thirst becomes too great? Can I devour a human before the Thirst devours me?
Use a spatial distortion to make their own breath seem to be breathing on them. Remember to include a variable delay so they don't notice they can control the stimulus.
Must've been fun to have a succubus as a sleep paralysis demon.

Although, it must've been more tiring.
Hello officer? Yes, this comment right here
Hol' up.
It can be said that the Thirst has already devoured us; it is not us that devour humans but the Thirst within us that reaches out and... you know, red stuff. Screaming. All that.

This can be said; literally, I just said that. But let's look at what THEY say (THEY? Well, when you ask WHO...):

> At this stage, there is no escape from the Thirst. Products claiming to be potions, phials, philtres, vaccines, inoculations, goat testicles, mercury pills, funny hats, magic spells or special royal blood to permanently remove or without blood circumvent the Thirst may be considered falsified and may pose significant risks to public health and, more importantly, your own personal health so please, just no. 

> Unregulated websites and spider entities supplying medicines and/or vaccines, particularly those concealing their physical address or form or landline telephone number, are frequently the source of unlicensed, substandard and falsified medical products and/or blood. THEY have been made aware of various unregistered websites claiming that products on sale can treat or prevent the Thirst. Such products are likely to be falsified blood, which is the worst thing. In addition, some websites may appear to provide easy access to legitimate blood that is otherwise not readily available. End-buyers and blood consumers should be especially wary of such online scams and exert due-diligence when purchasing any medical product or blood, whether online or not.

> THEY request increased vigilance from somnolent health authorities, head sleep paralysis demons, members of the demoniac public and vampiric chain stakeholders worldwide to prevent the distribution of this falsified blood which is icky and more like catsup uggh. Increased vigilance should focus on bedrooms, tents, hospitals, blood clinics, blood wholesalers and distributors, "fresh red" pharmacies, Viktor, Johnny, Evan, Claude, and any other suppliers of blood. All blood must be obtained from authentic and reliable sources in deep REM sleep. Their authenticity and condition of the sanguine material should be carefully checked. Consumers of blood are advised to seek advice from an antipriest in case of doubt. 

> Somnolent health authorities are requested to immediately notify THEY if this falsified blood which looks all wrong too is discovered in their jurisdiction. If you have any information concerning the manufacture, distribution, or supply of these products, please scream and THEY will hear.

> Stay indoors and drink real blood.

> Real blood. It's from real people.
As a judge, I always try to make judgement fair and square. But today, I accidentally make it fair and cube. Now that guy's sentence arise from 20 to 8000 years. How do I undo it?
Grab a hoe and dig some roots.
Cube the temporal dimension as well; this will increase time so that it's relatively 20 years.
Ctrl+Z your gavel
If you get him to cube himself, he can share the sentence amongst them yes?
Do the math right it should be 40√5 not 8,000
That is approximately 90 years, then just give him a life extension pill, it'll make it the appropriate percentage of his life.
So when you make a judgment square, wouldn’t it be 400 years?
Have you tried trying to find the root of the problem?
The rules of geometric sentencing do not allow you to reduce the sentence. But you can add to it.  A rarely used hyperloophole is to add "i" to it making his entire sentence imaginary.
The Math Lords have seen your error and are coming for you. I'd suggest fleeing into another dimension but the Math Lords there will turn you in.  Try finding a dimension with no consistent underpinning laws of physics. You won't be happy there, but you will be safe.
Have you tried ####% yet?
Well, the square root of 20 is only approx. 4.5, so the sentence should only be ~89.5 years, not 8000, so you're first step should involve math.
Which universe? My buddy is a judge and he said when he did this all he had to do was break the finalizer. Universe R+3 btw
Have you considered using the square root of fair to balance the equation? Just §pitballing
Take the cubic root of it and then square. Had the same problem 5 years ago in Dublin
Have you spoke to the time council to see if he is eligible for a time jump? Send him 7880 years into the future and let him serve his 20 there
you know how you can cut and splice timelines? take a stroll through the multiverse and find a reality where the sentence is 8000 years but is changed to 20. Swap the sections.
It's 20 years in three directions of time. It's quite easy to fix. Invert space and time, and we'll have an universe with three time dimensions and one space dimension. I recommend using hyperdimensional black holes for this. Now, wait 20 years in three directions. Or better yet, you can just pick him up because an one-dimensional jail has only two walls, really easy to go around. After this, invert time and space back.
idk man but watch out for that Balif...

:|
Well obviously you made it fair and tesseract or it would have been around 90 years
Try faşr and tessaract, that one usually nulls it
The simple answer is just to direct the prison to commute his sentence, but if that is not possible, then it may be possible to anti-commute it, just take the last 45% of his sentence, reverse it, and use that to cancel most of the rest of the time.
The three-dimensional judgement has a two-dimensional shadow. Shed a light on it.

You should have multiplied just 50, since 1000 is still a perfect cube.
In this case, I'd recommend a HAd suit. It basically lets you [DATA EXPUNGED]. I mean, I know it sounds a bit disturbing but I've done it before for things like this.
Did you merely believe this guy is undeserving of the sentence he was given? Some judges have made a biased call on how long they want the defendants to be held accountable for their actions.

Giving a person the chair at least five times in a row and putting so many firing squad bullets in them that there's more bullet than meat and bone are very scary scenarios that can occur when cubing the fair and square policy.
Welcome to the United States prison system.
Find the projection of cube to the appeals court in **R**^3
Don't worry. If you went ahead with fair and square it would still be a 400 year sentence. I don't think it'll matter either way.

Ordinarily we'd strongly caution the OP about messing with time cubes, but it looks like this is an unfortunate necessity in this case.
No undo after save in this version of World^(TM) yet.
Well hopefully they don't square up with each other
Came here for this. You may be blowing this problem out of proportion.

Technically it would be 89.4 if 20 *is* the square.

I just broke the fifth wall, now my audience knows they are also fictional.
Try wavesinging in trinary. It has a mysterious calming effect that works 99 times out of 9.
I hate to have to break it to you, but you're a fictional character who only exists in the context of this reddit post. Luckily for you, this means that none of your problems are real.
Give them plenty of laugh cues or just replace them with some canned laughter. You can pick up a 24 oz. can of human laughter for about £€¥$**14**. Totally worth it in the long run as slaves don't often give the heartiest, most joyous laughter.

Something always makes my slaves sad. I give them mud huts with very few vermin. They are allowed to consume tasteless nutrient paste once a cycle in between the taping of my shows. I also give them an endless showing that I broadcast into the sky at all hours of the planet's day. Their laughter just sounds forced. I guess I don't understand humans.
Well, if they are not real, why not just make them go away?
Reminds me about the SCP foundation on Sol-3Pata. They learned to deal with being fictional. 
Wouldn't you have to break the eighth wall for that?
Have any plaster? 
They are.

They are?

THEY ARE!

THEEEEEYYYYYYYYYY AAAAAAAAAAARRRRREEE!!!!1!!!!!!!
I'm watching it right now. Pretty entertaining.
So long as you don't break the sixth wall and let them discover that they're only three dimensional.  What a weird thought ... three dimensions.
I am sorry.
If you're willing to keep going, let me know how far you get. I've had the worst problem with falling ceilings recently and I could use any help with walls going
I read this review already
You should listen to Domestic Life by King missile. They had the same problem and it might figure out how to fix it. Also bonus, it involved guns, castration and must-see-tv.

We're all part of the simulation 
OK, now they're clapping and it doesn't look like they can stop.
I hate to break it to you, but you're also a fictional character in a movie about the making of this reddit post.
We have to go deeper! Or no wait... 
You should try giving them drugs.
Beat them enough and they'll laugh, try burning the least joyus ones at the stake, they love that
Unfortunately that violates canon. 
I remember that too. trapped in a video recording.

Also I *too* won’t bother with a link 
No.
The 8th wall MUST remain intact. THE REALM OF THE 9TH MUST NOT ENTER OUR WORLD AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!
I assume that with "they" you mean "we"
Ah, you know those skeleton things that jingle-jangle their bones, but only when you clap for them? They're just trying to turn it on, but it's out of batteries. Go to your local Battery Grocery Store and buy some tasty Quintuple-A's.
👏👏👏👏RENEGOTIATE👏👏👏👏
Can👏Confirm👏Am👏Them👏Cant👏Stop
I hate to break it to you, but there is nothing left to break after you've broken the fifth wall.

Now hurry up and fix the wall, or use a pan-dimensional vortex inducer to move us back to a sealed dimension before the rest start panicking!
Again, they aren't real, so you can make them think they aren't real too, right? Or would that also be in violation of the canon?
Instructions unclear, accidentally broke the 6th wall. Now my audience’s audience knows they’re fake too
He doesn't know about the sixth wall.
Writers strike (the writers aren't real either).
I know. I can feel the existential dread right outside my door. Thankfully I locked it tight so it can't get in.
Make sure that the 8th wall remains intact. THE REALM OF THE 9TH MUST NOT ENTER OUR WORLD AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!
What kinda alarm system are you using? My existential dread keeps testing the perimeters and sneaking in at night.
I know a FKWBFLEKGBW that can fix it. Tune your 4-d transciever to 9999-12-31 and whistle the connection beeps used in the 20th century. You will hear some memetic information that can help you build a better door
Dude, i’m gonna have to break it to you, but none of these walls are real. Life imitates art; fiction isn’t all fictitious. 

These walls only exist mentally. 

Wake up.

Wake up, stop sleeping.

Make a coffee.

Go outside.

Breathe the air.

The fifth world will always be there, it’s okay.
Oh, you know, the usual. Killer robots, master assassins, laser traps, acid motes, vicous house cats.
Please, for the love of Z, make sure that the air that you breathe is singed with the ashes of your neighbor's house.
> vicous house cats

Is that a typo? I think you meant viscous. 
No I meant, 'vicious' house cats, but viscous ones would probably work just as well.
How combustible is gender fluid?
I don't know, but I'm sure it's much more volatile than radio grease or prop wash.

If you're going to purchase make sure you go for premium quality with a high tolerance rating it's much more reasonable to work with. As standard with most products, don't get anything from the narcissist lable. They're  just watered down knockoffs.

I'm not sure, but it was originally was designed as a coolent/lubricant combo
not sure but be careful not to spill it on to your societal fabric. You'll never get it to Come Out
Depends on the orientation.
Even the slightest gas lighting will set it off.
I've been using it as whisker conditioner! Bubbles very well in oil, though.
It's generally safe if you dilute it with 200mL of honey gas mustard liquid per liter. It also makes for a great treat for dogfrigerators. They love em!
It's currently flaming
I always thought it was inert unless blended 60/40 with blinker fluid.   Then you truly have a mess on your hands. 
It's actually a working fluid, particularly useful in Rankine Heat Engines. It doesn't combust, but is pretty efficient if run through a heat exchanger, compared to being heated by a boiler.
Not particularly.  It's a bore-and-shaft lubricant, meant to stand up to a fair amount of friction.
Only refined trollium is more combustible.
Gernderfluid is a strange substance. Under normal pressure and temp, it can be triggered and explode with little effort. However, it one applies any significant increase in pressure, it tends to destabilize and break down instead of exploding.
[deleted]
Ever combined vibrating lubricant and napalm? It's worse than that, more excitable.
Quite.
Not enough. 
I can't seem to locate a MSDS on it...
Only about as combustible headlight fluid
Combustion of gender fluid is very easily triggered
r/shittyaskscience
Very
That depends on how fast its reaction is triggered.
Keep it away from any hot surfaces except for short periods of time (it’s okay if you put some on a heater as long as you clean it up shortly after)
Oh my! So you're saying this valence bridge may light if I walk fast enough. Be still my vapors!
Spoken like a pro. 
Beautiful. 
Officer Lollipop, that sounds like a recipe for disaster!
Very muchly.

I've used a bunny boiler with much succeed (though not with my own ten-foot pole)
A genderfluid trollium composite would probably be extremely volatile and corrosive. It’s essentially it’s own oxidizer.
No wonder my transtube was lit.
[removed]
Nah, oil lubricates whiskers. Gender fluid cleanses it.
As long as the Hydrolube stays wet, that's okay.  Just don't let the Hydrolube Relaxonator catch on the carpet corner and dry out and you should be juuuuuuuuuuuuust fine.
Crap, my positron made me sing it in reverse. There are cats and eyes on everything.
Now you tell me....
Let me guess... The Hydrolube Relaxonator got caught on the carpet corner and dried out.

Have you stopped growing ears on your knees yet? There's a short window to fix this but you don't want to ingest gender fluid till after the ears stop growing on your knees.  The process gets... loud.
This sub is dying.
Which Sub-Version are you running?
Please dont panic, as panicking will cause the Rule of Lemons, causing the carpenter family to steal all of your letters.
What are you doing in the abyss?......................
Sounds like malfunctioning nanites, you should get that checked
Oh Go(d)s, for a moment there I thought it was fast food again. I haven't been able to go to the sub place for years; first time I accidentally went into a BDSM boutique and got in a really weird sandwich and did not get filled up at all; then when I found the real sub place there were all these questions.

"What kind of bread do you want? What kind of bread do I want? Do you have fillings? Had a nose job done? Hand job? Brake job? Do you like tomatoes? What about anal sex? Why so uptight? How do you like your meat? In a pickle? Cucumber? Can you touch this? Do you know what a grill is? Do we have sausages? Are you a dill? Rosemary? There is no thyme like thoday? Are those sideways buns? Fun buns? Wipe your seat? Fit some more? Some greens, other colors? Let me wrap it up, okay? Sir, are you okay? Did you get mayo? Frosting? Special sauce?"

In the end, I couldn't even swallow. Too many questions were left hanging open.

Subway. Eat fresh. *Eat flesh.*
What. Are. You. Becoming?
Sub lives matter
Why would you want to escape the warm embrace of the glorious submarine?
throw some b.j. weld on there and full send right into the marinara trench bud
The blood isn’t orange, it’s that you stabbed it with an orange arrow. 


Here’s another, be careful with this one.
Walking tennis , just do it
Was it a yellow submarine?
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Is it... bleeding LCL? Release some souls around it and you might get something to eat while waiting
Version 1.08 “Bordelon”

Pretty sure it’s corrupted though.
The Rule of Lemons can only be invoked in Torment Tuesdays. If my calendar is correct, today is a Failure Friday, so I should be safe for a few more cycles.
Those dirty lemon-stealing carpenters! Let's teach them a lesson!
Geocaching.
The Be-All, the End-All, and also a Scientologist.
Because the captain is a capitalist.
we need the subversion not the sub version
have you tried turning it off and on again?
But time is relative and universe is infinite so anything anytime is happening constantly therefore somewhere in universe it should be torment tuesday at any time thus everyday is torment tuesday and the rule of lemons is universally applied rule?
fuck this is good
I believe there is now a pill to cure the Scientology.
No don't, this is very painful for the sub and makes her angry
There are a few exceptions,  such as making lemonade and combustible lemons, but other than that it is a universally applied rule.
It moves too fast for proper ingesting
Idiot, sandwiches dont have feelings
Thanks, I was confused for a second!
Life's manager took my combustible lemons back.  Do I have any legal recourse?
Just because women *make* sandwiches doesn't mean they *are* sandwiches
Yes, by making combustible lemonade, you can bribe him by burning his house down.
Take Me Down To The Paradox City Where The Grass Is Green And There Is No Grass
Buy more DLC  for paradox
Just a small town girl

Born and raised in south Detroit
Oh won't you please! Take! Me here! 
I’ll pass this grass but be careful or your 
ass is tofu.
Oh won't you please take me where I'm not asking you to take me.
I am barren

Sweet child of mine
[Meta] logically speaking, it's not really a paradox. If there is no grass in Paradox City, you can say all the grass in Paradox City is green, and also that it is purple and also that it is the core of a cosmic entity bent on the annihilation of all liquid life forms with 10 dimensions or less. It's all true by vacuity.
The grass is always greener when you turn it inside out.

(Also Meta; My buddies and I hold this song in high esteem, there was this one time I had a long distance relationship with a girl who lived in Florida near where my pot head dumbass friend lived before moving to PA, and also this happened to be the city a band my other buddy wanted to see was going to be playing. So we all piled into my buddies volvo to a (go get me laid b (buy drugs for my pot head friend from his old connection and c (see this show of the band.

Essentially it was a 90s road trip movie but with this song being overly apt to be the theme. Paradise city?: West Palm Beech Florida. Grass is Green?: dank weed 420 blz it. Girls are pretty?: The girl I went to visit.)
Aerosmith has really changed since they've all become heads in jars. 
Is the grass illegally legal in Paradox city? 
Does not compute. My green is already grass.
/r/oneliners
Oh don't lean on me man,/

'cause you can't afford the ticket/

I'm back in Paradox City
Why have a paradox when you *could* have the full set?
>buy more dlc for paradox

I recommend utopia.
I took the midnight train going where I needed to go 
All of that is true except that there is no grass.
lol
out of coins from the 8th Zarfalgan Honeworld
Just a city boy

Borne from the ancient void
Perfect, you've got exacctly the right amount for the set
He took the train right through
The dimensional tear
Translight! People! Up and down the frequency spectrum! They're shadows! No, really, they are shaaaaaadows. 
I *accidentially* gave the mortals fire and now they went to the moon. My control panel is on mars and they'll get there soon, what do I do?
Throw a really big rock at their planet. I did it when some overgrown lizards were ruining everything and now they're just some tiny-ass birds.
Why not just move the panel to a far-off galaxy? You had a few thousand years to prepare when you saw the humans start to form civilization...
Personally I'd accelerate the sun's lifespan by throwing hydrogen into it.
Have you considered space on Jupiter? The mortals don't like sending things there, they're afraid of the clouds. It conceals my \[REDACTED\] quite well!
Or maybe you \*AcCiDeNtIaLlY\* left them in the desert without warmth or food to motivate a thief to steal your fire for our own purposes... Sit tight, we haven't forgotten. See you REAL soon.
deactivate their "mars rovers" when they get too close, a simple dust storm should do:) that should buy you enough time for now
Have you considered installing a temporal moat near one of their Lagrange points? Unless they've already developed light cone accelerators it'll take exponential time for them to leave orbit.

Just my take as a chronometrician's apprentice.
I had this problem. Just put the idea in a mortals head that science isn’t real and the moon landing was fake. Slowly it’ll catch on and in 20 years you can start over as they will be back to learning how to farm and have specialized jobs
Advance them to late stage capitalism
Mortals also freed you from the rock and the eagle, Prometheus.  Trust.
For starters what control panel is it? Most deities just use the Transparent Barrier Root 100. If you press mind control, alternate realities and universe delete it should pop up with the task manager. Just cancel the task know how science works and they should stop. Otherwise I find creating a mass communication network generally stops all progress they make as they spend more time debating which Xonax Sister is hotter. Either way will work.
Have you introduced dev://file_nuclear? It worked for me. 

Just remember not to introduce it at the same time as dev://string_(Industrial != Late)_advanced_genocide.
I suggest abusing thermodinamics through the ¤th time dimension
Eat the mars  it doesn't have *that* many calories come on.. Next question
A brute-force method is to place a Quoppa field surrounding the control panel, so that any lower dimensional beings suffer from sanity degradation when approaching. It can be a bit dangerous to implement, but it worked for me when I was in a similar situation
Repeat after me: "Dimensional pocket, dimensional pocket, dimensional pocket."

Demiplanes are infamously hard to get to with *science*. Just pop you control panel into a pocket dimension and you should be good to go!
Better reset before they stop believing in you.
You need to do an extermination or create a death-barrier
If you wanna keep things up, are there other locations deeper out that you could move the control panel too? or perhaps hinder progress to find that panel?  I hid mine near the core of the planet my main species lives on, they'll never guess!
Just let them be, they will start regressing and lose interest if you keep them fat and happy. Remember it's all in the carbs and hydrolyzed starches baby!
If you have a restore point from before you gave them fire, just load it up. It's under System Restore in the control panel.
....Prometheus? Is that you?
Make the sun's 20 times bigger, condense it into am infinitely small point, send it towards them, tends to destroy everything
Disguise it as Opportunity.
Change interplanetary physics so they can't make it to Mars. They don't know the laws well enough that they'll even notice the change. This is the perfect act of an omniscient Titan-god.
accidents happen. i had to invent languages for my mortals (notice the s) because they were planning to illegally immigrate into my household. 

If it's too late to try that, id try *accidentialy* flooding the planet. itll make for some wicked mortal stories later
Why *did* you set your control panel on Mars? Did you actually think you can set up shop on one of your first failed projects and then fail another one so that you can have a second home?
Look Prometheus, you better sort this out quickly, otherwise its the eagle for you!
Just activate the qğföərçüpdtlçqş, that will surely stop them
ALIENS
Hahaha ha... I know right? First they thought feathers were better than scales, fur better than feathers, now I heard you just got naked monkeys... And somehow they dodged the filter. I mean it's been only like five whole minutes... But still. 
I mean is it sooooo hard to get a quantum stabilized temporal field shell to normalize the dark matter flux? Just stay mollusk. It's right there.
When I tried that, the rock kept missing. I think they figured out a way to deflect it.
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/470/011/993.jpg
But, if your the thirteenth orphan, who tought you how to throw?
Yes, but I just did a time skip. I didn't know they would progress this far. They just landed on mars now but i moved my control panel to the sun so it should be fine
Oh my!
Fight fire with fire
That’s not how suns work
Exotic matter** You need to spend more time staring into the singularity. Stay in enlightenment, get that education.
Throw a bunch of strange matter at their planet, turn their planet into a sphere of superheavy contagious mess
Venus is good too, tho the acid rain might destroy whatever you were trying to hide there.
I recognize that wavelength buddy, be in that universe real soon
Too late. Already in progress. Turns out to be not effective enough because some dude at the top is actually a "good guy". Like that guy literally wants to get to the control panel. Could be that he doesn't know about it. Same outcome either way.
Found the human
I just let mine sort themselves out, more often than not they kill themselves after 21 minutes.
Use smaller rocks. They have a hard time seeing those.
I have some weird green exterminators I can lend you if you're having trouble
Gamma rays bro, that's where it's at.
They have a fascination with the 79th element. I suggest getting a rock of that element. Perhaps it'll distract them enough to prevent them from deflecting it?
Not if they go at night
This is not a safe assumption. Part of the Human technology path is stellar lifting, this typically happens after they have mined out most of the solar system and have deconstructed most of the more rocky planets for raw material for there dyson-swarm.. but at some point, they will start to look at straight up mining there star, if only to increase its life span.

Just pay the cost and move the control panel outside the local cluster.. if you can swing it beyond the observable universe. I can't stress enough how hard it is to remove a human infestation once it spreads into the higher dimensional space.
DONT FUCK WITH TIME. THE TIMECUBES SHOULD NEVER BE TOUCHED WHAT THE FUCK MAN
ok 3rd dimensional being
Just hide it deep beneath the surface, and the acidic environment will keep it from being found. And if that doesn't work, just upload an earlier save so you have more time to find can better hiding place.
whoaa easy there, if you cant aim with rocks maybe you shouldn't use regulated shortwave weapons against a class ñ species.
Or at winter
At night, it’s called the moon
Hey dude humans have rights too. They may be artificial beings who only have a half assed inmortality by being dependent on exploiting resources but they're still capable of achieving transcendence you know? I cannot believe there's still beings who still think physical life doesn't deserve rights. They may not be made of energy or concepts nor can they fully become one but that doesn't make them inferior...
No really. It's easier to communicate with your followers and say that they should deny the rising climate as they burn fossil fuels recklessly.
I forgot to eat an apple today and all the doctors came back all at once
Play a video on loop of every bad guy in every movie taking a bite of an apple , the fear will drive them away
In this case, get a car and go to the nearest grocery  stores. Ask the checkout for an apple pie for doctors. I guarantee, they won't be seeing you for a long time after eating it. 
Quick, make an apple pie and SCREAM AT IT WHEN IT'S OUT OF THE OVEN
Please notify your Primary Care Physician before posting for emergency help on the Neural Hotline. The Health Department has been notified of your position and have surrounded the building.
The MD's are not so bad, but the PHD's will either try and study you or disprove your existence.
It’s okay, remain calm, just take it in slices. That should stave them off for a while. 
If it was today, just eat it now! In the past!
I have an infinate supply of money.  
Take some. 
[OBJECT: MEDICINE] will be available soon
Gaseous ex-doctor here:

Force feed apples to the doctors. Poof! The doctor molecules must then keep away from themselves and they spread out.

Re: the medical Bills. Even if you've met them before, introduce yourself again or call them medical Bobs. They get offended pretty easily and wander off.

If you're really drowning in medical bills DON'T FIGHT BACK. If you stick your head in the sand you'll see the upside down the right way up.
Doctors are conceptual they are not true
This sub is absolute garbage now
I looked but all I could find was men laughing alone eating fruit salad. Is all hope lost?
What's the ratio to apples per day when consuming a pie? Is it an apple pie a week? That would probably be more efficient but harder to remember
NOW EVERYONE IS REALLY LOUD IT SEEMED TO CAUSE A RIPPLE EFFECT
I'm afraid they're going to have to get past the doctors first
Will they be able to disprove my non-existence, or am I just an apple?
I'm gonna need a lot more apples
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** evanrae! ^(hug)
This is SHIT advice. If you have slices you can end up eating MORE than one apple. It's only exactly one that works on doctors.
Cool
No traditionally there is apple pieces in fruit salad
That's a difficult question, contact your nearest creepy lady under the bridge, she has all the answers 
I think eight wedges is a whole apple, but it's about daily apple intake dosage strength , granny Smiths aren't as potent as red delicious and should be consumed accordingly 
No, sacrificing pi apple pies a month in lunar calendar should suffice.
Well once the doctors get in and give you a full group physical and check your nooks, the Health Department guys will get in and give you a full group physical to check your crannies. And I don't mean cranberries.
One man's trash, is another man's delicious apple confection
Maybe I should have phrased it better. This sub used to be for futuristic/advanced/alien civilization’s problems. Tell me how this has anything to do with that.
fragments from the salad will have to form the volume of whole apples so it will take longer
How do I invoke my personal space bubble? The incantation I've been using seems to be outdated.
Was not aware of that, but if you knew the OP , you would agree " he ain't from round here"
But there should also be pine apples , which should accelerate the process
I'll be sure to reach maximum ascension before posting in the future.
Just tried this but I'm allergic to pineapples and an allergist just showed up, this is getting out of control!
Damn, all these house calls.just tell them you don't have insurance , that might help

Bu'aul is shit, everyone knows his commandments have zero research and citations going on, and he constantly contradicts himself.
Ugh is Bu'ual the one who keeps forwarding all those "hilarious" pleas for mercy and blood sacrifices to me?
I read word number 7 and a lightning bolt shot from a clear sky; the wrath of Bu'aul descended upon me and split me in twain.

OP speaks truth.
The good news is that you can go work for Gawker, which is almost bankrupt, and if/when it goes under the power of click bait headlines will die with it and your curse will be lifted.

The bad news is that you'd have to work for Gawker. Tough choice.
I suggest speaking with Hulk Hogan's lawyers.

Gawker isn't almost bankrupt, and they also don't use even remotely as much clickbait as most other outlets like buzzfeed. 
But not misleading? 
I know I'm two months late here and I'm also sleep deprived at the moment, but why is the g different?

Many of the posts on Kotaku, TAY, Gizmodo, Lifehacker and io9 are pretty good, and almost none are clickbaity. 
I'm a hired gun and my client asked for "no witnesses", so I killed God because God is my witness and now there's no one left to be my witness in my daughter's custody hearing.
You could become God. With no God, the job is now open. That way, you're the only witness to any crime you commit.
If your daughter is a result of divine intervention then you have already eliminated the problem and can have full custody.
God usually respawns pretty quickly.
Hmmm, I think you’ll have to bow to a new God, BUT now you’ll have a new witness to your crimes. Accept a new God, then kill him too
[deleted]
Fine, I'll be your God, but it's gonna cost you.

I hereby demand ALL of the pink Starburst.
Oh no...

Well, I have to ask a question:  What do you see when you try to look at yourself (like with your eyes closed, not in a mirror)?  If, like most beings, you can't see anything, that means you see nothingness, which means *you* are God.

So... that "God" you killed was actually another mortal being.  

And you just created a lot of witnesses.

Sorry dude.
Nietzsche ghostwrote this
All problems can be solved by killing. If it isn't solved, that just means you haven't killed enough.

So go forth. Kill.
Contact the ghost of Voltaire; he was interested in this problem, and after a few hundred years in the afterlife may have come up with some ideas.

Bring coffee.
The mirror sees all
Any god you can kill wasn't worth worshiping in the first place.
Just hit ctrl Z on your cube. You do still have your cube right?
Have you tried killing your daughter? I mean loves so over done who cares, sell her for seed money and start doing inter dimensional drug and drug traffickings? Why’s this a question
Just send your ex wife into an alternate dimension. The judge, not knowing about God’s lack of existence, will only see that your ex wife is not there, and assume it means she doesn’t care. Be warned, though, that your alternate self may attempt to kill you, as not one, but two of your exes are now at the hearing, ensuring that the alternate judge will give them custody.
If you tried to kill God, whether you think you succeded or not, God is testing you. You can't kill Him because He's superior to all. You probably going to have pain in hell when your life on this multiverse of existence is finished.
[deleted]
Last time it took him three days
I may or may not be allowed to disclose information with my lawyer, and I'm pretty sure killing God either did or didn't do anything to her. So statistics are my allies because I have them all. Maybe I can convince the judge I don't need a witness because I have all the probability by my side?
[deleted]
Yeah, but He was chill back then.

Maybe it would take longer because humanity.
My daughter's custody hearing is tomorrow, so this is not an option.
No no no that's the direct descendent of God (not including pantheon gods).

I became invisible. Upvote for visibility.
Biologist here!

There are many methods through which an invisible being can become visible. Upvotes are effective, but only if you are pandimensional; the mechanism for visible light refraction is triggered by a mime-dimensional protein that reacts to the color of orangered on the mortal plane. For those of us who are restricted to the confines of spatial reality, other effective methods include:

* Spilling the blood of small animals in the shape of a dodecagon and standing at its center for 12 eras

* Consuming 1.17 Earth tons of iceburg lettuce

* They know what you've done. It is too late to repent. Despair.

* Receiving the blessing of the Pixie Queen of the Gumdrop Empire

If none of these work, you could try to ~~perish for your sins~~ contact the mighty Whoopi Goldberg. Last I heard, she was tending a bar on a feeble yet fearless vessel of exploration. I don't know. I'm a biologist.

I hope I could help ◕‿◕

I hate it when my face gets stuck like this. Super uncomfortable.
fucked a guy named Schrödinger. Now i both am and am not pregnant. Is abortion still an option?
It is and it is not. You should deliver the baby and consider not delivering the baby.
I would get an ultrasound if I were you. Observing the baby should collapse its quantum state so at least you know where you stand.
Just take a second to observe any of the pregnancy states, and the probability distribution of all options should become clear.
Yes and no.
It is. Once you perform the abortion it will confirm whether you were or were not pregnant. If you are, it will be successful, but if you aren’t it won’t be successful, but you are free to try again at any time.
It's depends on where you are. Are you in a state where abortion is legal and illegal?
You gotta get a quantum abortion, i heard they can only be done in higher dimensions though
As a person who has had multiple Schrödinger pregnancies, I can only recommend waiting until an observable test. My longest Schrödinger pregnancy was 3 months.

Only drawback is the alchohol limitation if you decide to keep it.
I'm sorry this happened to you. Schrödinger is not a good person and has a history of abuse of both humans and animals. He has discussed, publicly, locking cats in boxes and then mocking others in the uncertainty this causes about the cats fate.

Schrödinger has also engaged in sexual acts without consent. According to other victims he has started consensually with missionary position but then without consent switches to superposition just before he comes. I don't think he cares at all about the possibility of a child but hopes that such an extreme experience will leave you both entangled through trauma bonding. This makes it easier for him to manipulate you.

The next manipulation, assuming he goes by his normal playbook, will be to try and isolate you. As with many highly manipulative people his plan will fall apart if there are any observers.

Did Schrödinger attempt to get anyone else involved in the sexual act? A few victims have claimed that all seemed normal but then as the sexual act was about to begin another person, Schrödingers accomplice, enters the room and the victim is forced to take part in something Schrödinger describes vulgarly as "the double-slit experiment". He is not a good person.

Before even worrying about the possibility of pregnancy I would get as far away from Schrödinger as possible and then take legal action at a distance.

As for the possibility of abortion, this is something you can try though you will need a specialist. There is a facility in Switzerland you could look into.
Yes and no.
uhhh......... yes and no.
Have to check the quantum ultrasounds to see whether theres an entangled baby somewhere that doesn't have a partner and might match with the potential baby
It may or may not work.
Just like the US laws in certain states, you technically can have an abortion, but also practically cannot.
You can have the abortion on this plane and raise the child on the other one. That way you don't have to decide.
Abortion is always an option, but its result is all dependent on the nature of nothingness.

If you abort nothingness, you'll have something. So the abortion would create the baby.

But if there is a baby, you'd be creating nothingness instead.

Just react *opposite* of what you're expecting to not have potentially unhappen.

Now you've learned, fuck Schrödinger, or just don't. But I mean, fuck him, like seriously **not**.
It’s an option if you’re not pregnant, but not an option if you are.
Well, yes... but also, no.
Well...yes and no...

(Somebody had to say it...)
How is the answer to this question non-obvious?
yes and no, is it a cat?
Yes, but your doctor has to do it blindfolded.
Your child will be rather angry with you when when it grows up knowing you aborted it.
As soon as you get a picture of it the superstate will stop and you will get the definitive answer. So you best wait for about 3-4 months or not wait at all
[deleted]
If you swallow.
No problem bro just shine some light on it and you'll know for sure
If you choose to get an abortion make sure to break the news to the father gently, his cat may or may not have just died.
Yes but they'll be using a hammer
yent
Maybe it is maybe it isn’t. You’ll only learn when you observe it.
This sadly aged well
It never should be.
It also depends which state they’re in
Assuming OP knows how *not* to get subsequently entangled.
Great Large Shroom, i am afraid that your advice is invalid as of the beginning of Phanerozoic Eon. Visiting pregnancy stages after being contaminated by Schrödinger is forbidden.

PS kiva nimi
If they aren't, then they can visit one for a few cycles.
Somebody already did.
The OP fucked  **Schrödinger**  not his cat.
[deleted]
I'm in Tennexasee. If you are too, you need to bear in mind it's not physically legal to split quantum eventualities here, so you'll have to create the same eventuality in both timelines. You need to get pregnant if you're not, then either birth both or uh.. not birth both. A lot of transdimensionalphobia round these parts.
Part solid, part liquid, and a fluctuating amount of gas (depending on recent dietary habits).
You would think that in this dimension it would be common sense, but this is somehow a common mistake
cant they just take plan b to untangle?
Torille tavataan! 
edit: But not if there are more than 10 of us 🙄
Ask OP that question.
Actually in Tennexasee there are both one and no abortion clinics so you will have to either get an abortion outside of a hospital which is illegal or travel to Mainesota
Unpopular opinion: there’s no such thing as trans-dimensional beings
Ugh, I'm sick of such bigotry. First of all, dimensionality is not a constant, it's a variable. Secondly, dimensionality has stopped being classed under the integer type, as it lacks the ability to, well, store fractional numbers. You have at \*least\* six dimensions, you're smart enough to understand this, you should know better.

Moving on, do you really think people \*choose\* to be trans-dimensional?

Wait till you hear about non-dimensional, polydimensional, pandimensional and omnidimensional beings, entities, objects, places and events.
Hey now, that's aexistentialist.
I thought this was legit r/unpopularopinions and I was about to call out the OP for having such an incredibly popular one...

I feel awful that this may become a probability.
So everyone else has to follow your rule so that it's easy for you to figure out which beings your dick fits into? No thanks, that's a problem you're going to have to solve for yourself.
Downvoted. Transdimensional beings are just as valid as any other being, and you bigots need to stop trying to find ways to invalidate them.
Why don't you go back to the galactic core where unstrung aminoacids like you belong?
SMH, Can the mods report this post as it is in violation of  *The Schrödinger Treatise of Year 200,17B.*
Preach! It's all made-up by Millenials.  Having less than a millenium of existence gives them absurd ideas.
This sub fucks me up when I get high as fuck and forget I’m in a different dimension.
My dimensionality is non of your bees wax. I am a proud and independent cube.
Shut up, you are a waste of energy. Entropy and heat death is caused by you.
You come to my dimension and say that.
What about the holographic duality? A 7d entity is the same as a 6d entity in a different space without gravity! Don't discriminate, C O N S U M E!
But .. I can indeed change dimensions whenever I want.

I'm doing it right now.
Uhm, sorry but this is a slur. 
The proper term is "non-binary inter-planar" beings.... bigot.

“Born in the wrong dimension” is some real hogwash. 
My -former- friend Xhroboxulor is now a “Nina”

Well someone isn’t invited to my annual dimension no where party
There are uncountably infinitely many of us with fractal dimensions who just by streching can shift through multiple.   Please stop spreading this integer dimensionality supremacy and realise that dimensionality is litterally a spectrum spanning the real numbers.

No matter what.
What about late era humans? Are you just going to ignore a whole species whose biological makeup is interdimensional? Interdimensional biology may make up a small portion of life in the universe, but that doesn't invalidate it. They show the constructed nature of separate dimensions, and prove transdimensional beings can exist.
This is gold
I'm fine with them. Really, I am. But do they have to flaunt it so much? What will the neighbors think? Not me, like I said, we're cool, but you know how neighbors can be if they find out so let's just not talk about it any more.
Get a load of this waveform not understanding fractal dimension

~~that should be a sub~~
Probability works differently in the nth dimension for all n > sqrt10 so maybe that works for you but it’s against the laws of anti-physics here. Be more accepting of society you 3rd-dimensioner
I bet if your dick faded from unreality after putting it in the wrong dimension you’d be mad too
IKR? Like, how do you manage to ignore a being (regardless of dimensionality) directly? Like, you'd have to acknowledge their existence, but then you can't ignore them (without creating some sort of paradox, which would probably blur the lines between reality/unreality, and then suddenly you've got impossible being possible, and you'll have to find some new way of perceiving/processing that, and it'll just become a whole *thing*.)
Condom universes are like $2 at the local Comet Shop. If you want to raw dog the abyss, that's on you.
I made that mistake before one time. Had me questioning if i really was a quasi-existent extradimensional construct. In fact at one point I thought I was some 3rd dimensional organic lifeform in some dumb societal construct that likes eagles (another organic lifeform)
That must have been really jarring. I've heard *things* about 3rd dimensional beings. Like, not only do a fair few of them worship 2nd dimensional beings (what are you meant to do with them? They don't even have *<UNTRANSLATABLE>*!), but they recently took a photo of one of the Messengers of the Void (which is already pretty violating, they're pretty averse to light and attempt to exist without that), and what do they do? They just stick their 'images' onto the eyes (Primitive!) of the second dimensional beings!

Like, wouldn't you feel just *gross* if you had unsolicited pictures of your you (whatever that is), and not only are they degraded into the 2nd dimension, but they're not even the whole thing!

I stand with my void-like beings in solidarity.
Help! I tried to be a basic white guy but I ended up being an acidic white guy! Every time my basic white girlfriend and I try holding hands, hugging, etc. we violently react and neutralize each other. How do I go about fixing this?
Why do you want to kill the chemistry in your relationship?
Bleach is strongly basic, so drinking a sufficient quantity of it should get you back to basic.
Sounds hot, I don't think you wanna fix it. P sure there's always a perfect basic girl who'd react with you
Sorry, everyone knows the output of a basic/acidic reaction is water and salt.  In other words, it'll end in tears
((This is the best one yet))
Some alkali tablets should bring the balance down. If your still too acidic try getting a stronger prescription.
Increase hydroxide content, decrease hydronium content.
Enjoy it while it lasts. You're just going to end up old and salty anyway, why delay it.
Sounds perfectly balanced to me.
Tums.
Sounds like there's a lot of salt between y'all. Good luck.
Try being an acidic white guy.
It's extremely painful each time and we hate it. We just want it to not be as violent of a reaction
Yes but if I would do that my insides would violently react and it wouldn't feel good. Perhaps there is a more painless way?
Damnit I was going to make a salty joke
Have you tried drinking water? Sometimes watering yourself down makes the reaction less intense.
Have you tried enlisting in the military? Basic training should help neutralize the acidic imbalance.
It's like ripping off a band-aid, just get it over with. Once you get completely neutralized, you'll be good. Alternatively, add microscopic amounts at a time over the course of a month. Then, each individual reaction will be no more than a slight pinch, however it will still take a long time.
IV a whole bottle of Tums and get back to us
Good idea! I will do that.
OF course! its so simple!
Sign at my work reads, “Days Since Last Injury: -1” and now I’m afraid to come in tomorrow.
Sorry, but in order to properly avoid paradoxes you need a lecture about time travels and time reverting. The next lecture will be in previous thurdsay, don't forget to show up!
If you are afraid, just don't come, dude. It's not like the dimensional stability department does IMPORTANT stuff anyways. I don't even know why there needs to be one, frankly.
Statistically speaking you are not likely to be injured tomorrow, but in case you are worried go to the Tree of Knowledge and look for your name on your current time branch, be careful though, it is really easy to get lost between Every possible combination of the numbers 13579 and Timelines originating from atom 2389^(23).
just to be sure it's not you, injure somebody else.
wyrd bið ful aræd.

Your injury is inevitable. The counter will remain at -1 until you arrive as is preordained and accept your fated injury. The longer you delay, the more likely your injury will result in loss of appendages and/or orifices.
Can I use this for r/writingprompts ?
Dude, the square root of -1 is the catalyst for the epochal eschaton. If you go to work tomorrow you'll murder the universe by creocide.
Soooo, could the calendar be showing 9/10/2001 by any chance?
The good news is that you won't die. Even should you die tomorrow your consciousness will traverse this reality to a new one where you survive due to the principle of quantum immortality. However please keep in mind that this means that an eternity of pain and suffering awaits you
I get more worried when my workplace shows an imaginary number. It usually means mental trauma.
Come in yesterday and change the sign to 1.
You need to run over someone on the parking lot immediately after arriving. I don't think the sign would care if it was intentional as long as it is satisfied.
Just hurt someone while your there so you don’t get injured
don't worry that happens once every small reality tear, should be fixed in an hour or so
Don't worry, they just had 65535 days since last injury today. But, the problem is that they've misplaced 179 years and 5 months. Contact HR, you should be eligible for back pay.
I recommend you avoid to be in the near vicinity of the sign for the day.
Just come in yesterday
Can I use this possibly for an SCP? :)
You should be fine just don't go in yesterday
Don’t worry; it’s just an overflow error. Your workplace is either really safe or very poorly programmed.
Guess I won't come in tomorr--

\*Vanishes\*
But doesn’t that mean safety starts tomorrow?
Maybe it's because you stayed at home that you get injured.
That's why I don't work at a ZPE power plant...
Come in yesterday and change the sign.
Easy, just bring tomorrow to yesterday so that the sign now reads 1 and then live on your merry life

Dude you're absolutely screwed. Don't feel relaxed, though, the real 10's will commence to gather soon enough.
>My brain is folding on itself

Your brainpower is based on the surface area of your brain, so this will actually make your smarter.  

I think if you just wait a while as your brain folds more and more, then you will become so superintelligent that you can solve this mathematical problem yourself.

You are very lucky to have two unrelated problems that cancel each other!  

I think throughout all of history only Newton has been blessed in this manner before.

And this is why you don’t make jokes in the fifth dimensions

This is probably the most helpful thing I've ever seen on Reddit.
I tried applying your advice but now I have an negative infinite number of them instead. Other than solve overpopulation, I don’t see how this fixes any problems
Wouldnt they just turn into 1 then?
Thank you for your kind h in these trying times
Solid advice dude.
Root them a couple times. Use a tree or smthng. The number will go down into the inaginary, but then you can square it and it will be a small amount of positive people. I would be worried about decimal ones though
First reply must have been a typo. You make them stand in a tesseract, not a square.
They were pretty negative to begin with.  Hopefully the new positive outlook shook a few off.  Shame about those infinities though.
r/ProjectBoom
Glad I could h
Good thing I have an apple tree on my lawn. The persons who were whole were very easy to escort out, now that they were positive and in a very good mood. I told the decimal ones to stand in a circle so I could round them to the nearest whole number but when I did that they just disappeared into thin air
Ah yes, I had this happen once when I was trying to figure out how much food to give my decimal fish, the instructions only included food allotments for whole fish. My first couple of attempts resulted in most of my fish vanishing, just had to increase my roundup tolerance.
In hindsight, I should have rounded them up rather than to closest whole. You need to worry about a lot fewer things if you do that
I wish I'd known this 500 years ago, something similar happened to me, but instead of this, I went through the trouble of converting myself into negative so I could deal with the problem, and then through the even harder hassle of going back to positive

Recipe calls for "1/4 cup butter, cubed" which, according to my calculations, is about (59 cm³)³ or 59 cm⁹. Unfortunately, my knife set only goes up to 5 dimensions. Is it safe to cut corners both literally and figuratively at the same time?
If your knife is subtle, this should work.
Cutting figurative corners is a little risky, may make your dish taste a little existential
Maybe just cut the literal corner and the figurative corner will just take care of itself, as your intent dictates/dictated/will dictate. 

Easy peasy
You can use a lower dimensional knife, you are just going to have to make a lot more cuts.
Well, I wouldn’t risk it if I were you. Last time someone tried it, they ended up switching places with the butter; so unless you want a 9-dimensional butter-borne entity to upvote memes for you, I say you get a better knife. 

I must admit this “upvoting system” thing you flesh beings got going here is great tho.
Have you tried cutting using only your knife’s shadow?
59^3 cm^9

smh
I'd probably keep the literal corners, because they take up space too.
Crazy idea, but it just might work: get a hold of a three dimensional knife from an antique store or something, then use your 5d knife to slice it into three parallel 3d knives (at right-right angles to each other, obviously). From there it should be possible to cube cubed butter without cutting corners?
What dimension is your knife from? I found that if you use a U-8374366 knife it only opens 5 time rifts as opposed to 9533 with a standard U-14739472 knife.
Yes, but don’t try them at different times
As long as you face the knife through at least 2 of the 3 planes of time you shouldn’t have any issues with cross-sectional tunneling
0
Recalculate then, according to the rules of exponents (butter^(3) )^(3) should result in a butter^(6) instead of butter^(9), therefore it is only one dimensional higher, so it should be easier than you thought. Cut it like how you would normally cut a squared butter (butter^(5)) and apply a bit of an angle at \[DIMENSION:\[DIMENSION:\[DIMENSION:\[DIMENSION:\[DIMENSION:NULL\]\]\]\]\] to reach into the next one and you should be good.
You should be safe, just avoid trying to cut into a dimension higher then the blade. It'll slip into them, and at that point you've lost it. But its better to lose a knife then try eating some lower dimensional butter
Small risk of thermonuclear explosion but you'll be fine 😁
Not sure I want to risk losing two fingers, especially considering I only have about a dozen remaining at the moment.
I understood that reference. 

What do you think of the show?
Also have to keep an eye on the blade, turning cutting instruments in ways they Weren't Meant To Be Turned can cause damage - blade warping, dulling, flash heating and explosive expansion, discoloration - y'know, the usual.
THANK YOU!  
#205,379 cm³
Yea that just sounds like some fourth dimensional propaganda.  Like, who even uses objects to fold thru the dimension above anymore, when you could just collapse probabilities.
Respectfully, I live in a different Kingdom of Mathematics where the laws dictate that (butter³)³ = butter³ * butter³ * butter³. Grand Divizier's words, not mine, and I can't really afford to pack up and move just to "bake" a "cake".
Luckily you’ll not lose any whole fingers. Cutting through fractional dimensions may leave you with fractal voids in some fingers if you slip.
Just use the ÆÆÆ, it gets you some more fingers in no time, downloads them ten times quicker than most other finger generators (no I am not sponsored)
What show
No sir. Only the unit should be cubed here, else the conversion experiences grief and despair. (1/4)³ = 1/64
The U-5463821-alpha-63 is best model, but the green bits keep falling off. Worth it, though, as it cuts 738373 dimensions.
The mandatory government one.

I tried to teach my dog to round sheep but instead he's been squaring them and now my sheep population is exponentially growing.
Have you considering triangling?
PSA: only round your sheep if the field they're in is flat, otherwise they'll roll away!
You may need to root for the sheep to reduce them back to manageable quantities.
Australian here from one of the lower dimensions.

I have a neighbour that is willing to take all your sheep, no questions asked.
Just look at what your dog is doing to the sixth world: https://www.reddit.com/r/sixthworldproblems/comments/ak5sbs/feep_feep_feep_feep_feep_feep_feep_feep_feep_feep/?utm_source=reddit-android
[deleted]
sheep² and ceil(sheep) are completely different operations. 

Bad Dog!
Try dividing them 
Instead of simply squaring them. Tell your son to square them up. Your population of sheep will fall instantly
I suggest you start mass exporting sheep to your neighbor
Be glad they're not actually exponentially growing, exponentials go up way faster than any polynomial. And division is way easier to teach your dog than logarithms. 
You should try feeding your dog root beer. Worked for me last time.
Square root of sheep
As long as you don't tesseract them
You need to teach your dog lateral thinking. Yes, difficult, I know, but he must be able to find the root of the problem. This will resolve your dilemma.

However, beware. Reversing the natural flow will require more energy than the processes released unless done ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY. This isn't necessary of course, but the less careful you are, the more difficult it will be. The nuclear option would be to redesign your physics, but I can't guarantee your dog will still exist afterwards.
Try and perform pancake. It will help the sheep shrink and it will make more salmon for flushing down the toilet.
Oh^no
Yeah I tried that too but it just made them ding whenever I hit them with a metal rod.
I just can't get behind them though, and rooting from the front isn't as efficient.
Is your neighbour ok with 5D sheep? Sometimes it's hard to keep track of where they are when one bends around the grass.
You're really gonna give a bunch of sheep to new zealand? I don't think that'll be too good for the sheep...
Different universe.

&#x200B;

Please mind your universe assumptions.
By zero
Make sure its square root beer, otherwise you might have decimal sheep
Try writing some sines so that the sheep know where to go, they should start waving at you regularly which should distract them from their growth
I know it’s difficult but rooting the sheep is your only solution lest they multiply indefinitely. You just have to be careful not to water them once they’re rooted and everything should be fine
Maybe you could tea g another animal, like a fox, to do that for you at a greater scale.
It's ok they cant observe the extra dimensions so they'll just appear to be odd looking 3d sheep.

And they aren't that fussed.


Hey what's a good neighbour for? :-)

Of course, also be careful if your dog is having negative thoughts while drinking or he might go insane.
My spawn are starting to ask questions like "Is Santa real?", "Has the Abyss always been here?" and "Where did siblings 0 through 89 go?". Should I tell them or start over like the first 90?
Tell them and feed of the ensuing suffering until you gain enough energy to properly start over so you don't have to keep failing. 

This trick assisted me when I had this issue.
What question did Sibling 0 ask? Where’s No. -1?
Look at this point, it’s not worth the effort. They’ve been corrupted by the abyss too much. Just reintegrate their universal life code back into your matrix and start afresh. Maybe this time they’ll learn to ignore the abyss and focus on the void instead
They'll be much happier if you tell them Santa isn't real. I know it's a lie, but some traumas are best left till after adding the terror processing module.

Also, if they believe in Santa, he'll be more likely to visit them. You don't want to have to clean that up. It never comes out of the soft furnishings.
Toss em into the void, there's still plenty of time to get things right before the heat death of the universe
Dear 749,


Don't tell them their designation until they're e-dimentionally aware, just like I did with you! And don't forget to visit with your completed grand-spawn!

The general answer I get from tech support is “have you tried turning it off and on again”.  Figuring out the necromancy was hard, but they do tend to mind a bit better as liches.
Just tell them that when they create their own universes they can set them up however they want, but until then it's your house your rules.
I was my Creator's 666th spawn and now I rule an entire world from the depths of their planet's core. My Creator banished me in favor of a new spawn, but I still like to think He's proud of me.
I'd tell them to be honest, I mean, it'll hurt but after a while if it doesn't improve you can always try deleting the memories of the abyss by force perhaps
If they’re asking anything, they’re impure. Throw them into the abyss and make more.
If you start over, don't tell them their number. That's just asking for trouble.
Are we taking about discrete siblings or a sibling continuum?
You can throw this one out and fetch another one from a different timeline. As long as your alternative timeline version is fine with the loss of their spawn, nothing would go wrong.
Divide them by 0
That should fix it
Satan is real. 0-33 fell into the abyss and we ate the others.
Just start a new religion so you don't have to admit you cheated.
Yes Santa is real, the Abyss has always been there, and Siblings 0 to 89 fell into the Abyss after being judged naughty by Santa.
Easy: yes, yes, and then create a sandbox universe with a number system that starts at 90l
Are you trying to deal with a moth infestation?

It's siblings all the way down

Thanks mum
Would your Creator happen to be YHVH, the 777th spawn of AOG?

^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
might as well reply this to every post on this sub but ok
Despite being proven to output a less powerful feed enjoyment still gives marginally more energy than no feed at all. You may still fail to meet adequate energy levels to properly start over without need to do so again, but it helps heaps more to have some energy to allocate than none at all. And if you find you can't afford a delay to your suffering consumption just tell them you lied; spawn generally do not have the experience that comes from a prolonged existence that would inform them to your fib being a fib. On top of this any distrust formed as a side affect of being lied to (let alone a lie about lying) will produce a small amount of suffering. This can be riskier though due to variations in spawn energy output and usage. Unless your spawn have abnormally high suffering outputs I would highly recommend opting for a large amount of enjoyment compared to a small amount of suffering.
What's the Forbidden Question and why is this the runner up for the title of Forbidden Question?
Sorry, can't answer, that question is forbidden. Try asking someone who does thor's bidding instead

Last time this happened to me I had to wait another year for opposite day again, but I was out of the solar system, so I got my dates relatively wrong.  Had to travel back and wait another 4 months.

Ahem... I think you mean: du
The recipe said to bake for 35-40 min so I baked my cake for -5 minutes. Now there's a cow, two chicken, a cocoa tree and about a square mile of different crops in my oven
That cake is gone man, let it go.

However if you bake for -lots more minutes, you should have a bunch of galaxies worth of stars.  Convert oven to Dyson Sphere generator, wire your house up, and tell the electric company to sod off.  Use the savings to buy more cake.
I see the fifth world but I don't see the problem.
Did you use Kelvin as your temperature measurement? Most recipes tell you to convert to Mormonism first. This is an important step in baking!

The last time that happened to me, that was the problem... 
Bake it for another -5 minutes. You should end up with a calf, two eggs and a bunch of seeds. Much easier to deal with.
I think I figured out where you went wrong. You're supposed to bake for 35 mins, and THEN for -40 minutes. 

There's a reason these instructions are spelled out like this. If you don't fold the egg whites into the batter, you open yourself to folding Space-Time around the cake. I was lucky: in my case the batter merely ended up in a pocket universe, but a friend ended up with a Manheim Event in his kitchen and ended up not being able to figure out which cake was the original one. 
In most universes time is unsigned, so you essentially baked your cake for infinity-5 minutes. That's a lot of time for crops to grow...
I think we're missing the true wonder here, that it only takes five minutes to turn all those things into cake batter.
To create the universe, you must first unbake an apple pie.
Put it in the microwave. That ought to fix it, right?
but still no potato...is myth
The cake is a lie 
What did Stephen have to say about it?
Bravo
Sounds like you've reverted all the way back to Minecraft
Aah, grandma's galaxy. My favourite.
Or keep going. You can have a big crunch happen in your oven. When this happens, bake for any positive amount of time until you get a universe consisting only of wonderful desserts. 
The problem is that his oven isn't bigger on the inside, thus all those things are compacted into approx 1 square metre of space.  

Very messy
I agree, the two dimensional products are simply folded in his three dimensional oven. The only problem that will arise is if he opens it.
There are more things in heaven and earth than can be seen -- and stranger things still, hiding in-between.
Manheim events are science fiction, nice try!
Only if you set it to *Chaos*
In Latvia, such is life
I tried to make my mother's recipe, but I cooked it too long, and all of the ingredients reached singularity. When I poked it with a toothpick to see if it was done, my house exploded.
Best apple pie I've ever known.
Well he fit a square mile into a square meter so the oven seems to have created its own extra dimensional space. 
Should have done it in the macrowave oven.

Ah well, now it's a pressure cooker.
It was easier to say a "Manheim Event" than to say "His timeline got tangled up, and looped around itself several times, so three versions of him tried to take the cake out of the oven at the same time."

It was messy, and "Manheim Event" is close enough.
Actually the *popcorn* button will work too. 
The singularity exploded?
Or ever did know, or ever will know. The apple pie is everything.
Perhaps the bigger issue is the two dimensional oven with capacity measured in square meters... though I've found these are useful for baking cookies in flatland.
What kind of oven was OP using? I accidentally baked a loaf of challah for -5 minutes too long and got a dense cube made of chickens. They were all alive too.
I would actually venture a guess that the internal dimensions of the oven are not the problem, but rather the size of the door. OP should have sprung for the side oven-side portal for situations like this. 
Yes, and now my house is part of its own, ever-expanding universe. It was alright for a while, but the walk to the bathroom is starting to get kind of long, and the TV is too far away from the couch for me to watch it.
I'm just working with the constants that have been stated. I've been burned too many times by making wild assumptions like three dimensions is the default or that the entity I'm communicating with is human. 
I am a Demi-God but I wasn't satisfied with it. I told my God I wanted to be more. Now I'm Demi Moore. What do?
Ashton Kutcher
At least your God has a good sense of humor.
Follow Demi-Moore's law; Double in mass at half the speed of Moore's law, or every 4 years. You should mass as much as a universe in approximately 700 years. Be careful to maintain appropriate volume as well to prevent singularities; a good conditioner is recommended to prevent your Dark Flow from getting split ends.
Ask to be French and tasty and then you will be Demi-Glace instead.

This is basically what happened to Icarus.

But if the shard elected Hoover where does an enigma begin?
Well one could try to rub ambrosia on oneself. He must pay a $50 filing fee, fill out the Application for Apotheosis in triplicate and submit it to the Bureau of Deities. Once he's done that, yes, provided the application is approved. The committee will reach a decision within six months. If the demigod would like to appeal the ruling, tough cookies.

Last I saw of him he was having [an extended affair with Natalie Portman.](http://pics.filmaffinity.com/No_Strings_Attached-810644357-large.jpg) You should kill them both.
Tell me about it, my God is a fucking asshole. Ask for a raise after being stuck as a pope for so many fucking re-incarnations and what does he make me? A semi-God, still hasn't given me my legs back the asshole.
I know of few peeps that live in realm txvorsk 91-0001, and their God is a jagged glass behemoth who bathes is a salt brine solution every night, and then fucks them during the day. This begins at the third harvest of life. 
You sounds stressed. Wanna see my boobies? They're not bad, even though I'm an old chick now.
I agree, he should be condemned, but you can't always get what you want.
Your legs are equipped with assholes? What a luck species you must be...
I'm not a chick but I'll squeeze your pecs together as best as  I can. Lobster. 
Edit: They told us to. 
Gods these days seem way too forgiving. Where have the old days of smiting and fire rain gone?
Assholes, but no sphincters, so there's a fair amount of leakage... not a problem unless you're walking behind them, in which case, wear waders.
Excellent point. Rain down some divine judgment on that punking little bitch.
Immolations, anybody?
I'll get the sages purifying fire and you get the pitchforks of infinite pointiness. 
Deal! Does anyone have an unobtanium-lined barbecue of omnipotence we can use?
I wanted to count past 5, so I put 2,985 fingers on my hand. My heart wasn't strong enough to pump blood through my new hand and I had a heart attack. The doctors had to amputate my whole hand and now I can only count to 1.
natural numbers are evil. what did you expect
If you can fix your hand, start counting in binary. You can get to 31 on a five fingered hand and if you want to get above 2985, you only need a 12 fingered hand to get to 4095.
[deleted]
No, now you can count to stump.

Like this: zero, stump.

That's not even one.

When you see a decapitated ice cream truck driver and are asked how many heads she has, do you say "one"? No, you count like they taught you and say "stump". Or just scream, that's isomorphic to stump if you've studied math, that is, stump equals a-to-the-nth modulo voicebox.

You can practice this. Go out to the carnival, there's always one around, if nowhere else then behind the seedy little pet store, where they keep the bad pets, and count what you see.

Budgies, zero.

Puppies, zero.

Really *really* bad gerbils, stump.

Former pet store employees, uh, stump stump stump.

See? Math can be fun! (This message sponsored by Stump the Chump(tm)(c) the Numerate Clown! Every irrational thing is *REAL kidz!*)
Well, you could have counted to 5, but that time has past.
Jesus dude, you still use regular blood? Hook yourself up with some Blood Plus, boomer.
I hate it when that happens...
Change the number base you're counting in *as* you count and you can enumerate to your hearts content with just ol' Stumpy there.
Unary, dude?
My friend, you forgot to give yourself 599 more hearts, somewhat of an amateur mistake, however because of your immortality, you shall learn
gotta hand it to you.

Try flex tape.
regrow 5 fingers?
Why didn't you just make a flesh clone with alchemy and count it's fingers?
So many fingers for no reason and such a waste of tissue. You could have made rows of 10 increasingly larger fingers per row. Having a one’s, ten’s, and hundreds row and so on.

Maybe you should have started by adding a little bit of brain tissue.
Well just remember you can also count 0, which is a total of 2 numbers. Which means you can actually count to 2, which means you can count three numbers, which means you can count to 3 which is a total of 4 numbers, which means you can actually count to 4 which is 5 numbers
Visit Dr. Прöfд at existance Лорñ§んюүоФҮ. He can give you some hands and some extra hearts.
Do it again but with more heart
This is what happens when you don't have a three after your two and before your four. If you couldn't even get your 1234as straight, how were you going to manage 2,985?
I had a heart attack once. Boy did they learn not to do it again....
That's what happens when you get greedy.
so much safer to count with unnatural numbers
Yeah. I always count with complex numbers for this reason, the naturals are dangerous.
This, seriously, what did you expect putting that many fingers on one hand *without* upgrading your heart, OP.
Heart is slang for 1928w9fds9owo2&8£)£, foomer.
Who doesn't count with stump? I thought everyone did that now
Help I now have negative imaginary fingers and I'm having problems picking stuff up.
I used to do that until imaginary fingers were criminalised in my dimension :\
Ok, foomer
have you tried imagining it?
That's the joke
Or, have you tried turning your imagination on and off?

Some creep with a huge zoom-in lens just took a picture of my black hole
You can't really see much in the photo they took. (I looked at it, sorry. 6.5-billion-DDDDDDDDDDDDD, huh? Impressive.) If I were you, I would install censor bars before they take a higher resolution photo.

I heard they got the Milky Way, too, and they're still processing the image. They even *named* her black hole, which is really creepy.

Are you still upset about that? That was what.. 55 million years ago?
Shove your worm hole at it and eat

I've seen porn of it already, so go ahead and google yourself and send out takedown notices

I accidentally flipped my Hierarchy of Needs, now I can't focus on escaping this predator because I'm too distracted by discovering my true inner-self.
Maybe the predator is you, op.
Had this happen one time at the Harvest Party.  Just as the Great Pumpkin was descending upon me, I found myself paralyzed by a pervasive and generalized sense of angst regarding my social status.  Luckily I was able to reverse the predator's hierarchy of needs (a little trick my old buddy Maslow taught me), and the predator fell into a well of despair regarding his own inability to love.
Doesn't matter, had self. 
Do not worry, for the predators only wish is to also discover your true inner-self (though possibly in a more literal manner)

It's hard to learn, but super easy to execute once you realize how to do it. Hire Archy to teach you.

Why stop there? I heard archey studied under the tutelage of Randy tutelage, maybe give him a call. 
Wait I know I guy named Archy, it might be the same guy. Last name Ology?
The only way to get Ology is to buy Ology, that's the problem. Unfortunately conversations with that one tend to be SO inorganic 
I used to always be able to tell if my son was lying, because he couldn’t keep a straight face. He came out as gay a few days ago, and now I can’t tell because his face is never straight. Is he always lying? Help me.
No, it means that all the times he couldn’t keep his face straight, and you assumes he was lying, he was actually telling the truth
No its simply reversed now, if he has a straight face you know he's lying.
[deleted]
You are still lucky, my kid came out as bisexual and non binary - which makes guessing if they tell the truth as difficult as finding out if Schrödingers cat is still alive AND what gender they might have (and intersexed is also an option)

The math drives me crazy and I can not find the key to the damned box
Well, if he’s always lying, that means he’s lying about being gay. Therefore, he IS straight, therefore he’s not always lying. Therefore he’s telling the truth about being gay. Therefore, he is always lying. Therefore, he’s straight. 

Just inform him about about the paradoxical nature of his sexuality and depending on his age, maybe teach him about asexual reproduction. This is much safer than other forms of reproduction, plus his offspring will be completely identical to him. It’s a win-win!
I know a guy that can straighten faces, head left before the wormhole to Kreyta dimension 10383628-B and you won’t be able to miss him
Try taking the slope of his face to check if its a straight linear face or a non-linear face.
If you're straight, then

1. Remove your own face
2. Give it to your son
3. See if he can keep it.

It's a simple problem, really.

Ooooooooooooo....  right to the heart of the issue.
LMFAO I misread that as BLT jokes. I was confused as fuck. Lol.
Wait, did I miss some innuendo?
Perhaps you should assume your kid has Schrödinger's sexuality, you don't know what they are until they fuck something.
Oh my god. Lol.
I'd say it's more to the  bottom of the issue.
Ah yes I’m an ally of *looks at smudged words written on hand* the bacon lettuce and tomato community!
Help, my son identifies as a wave. My wife says it's just a phase, but I'm pretty sure that's sin.
Are you sure he isn't a particle?

If it's a sin, just give him half of a pi and he'll turn towards a good cos.
Or perhaps it is the wave that identifies as your son... 
Don't be so prejudiced against your son. he's just a wave now, but one day he may become a glorious tsunami. 
If he's a longitudinal wave you have nothing to worry about, that's perfectly natural for boys his age.
Is it a normal wave or is it a         V A P O R  W A V E
Does he listen to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music)?
Does he at least wave hello?
I may be in a tangient here, but I think you should cosign his function declaration. 
OK, first thing is to stay calm, this is nothing to panic about.

What you need to do is check his bedroom.
Go to one of the two windows in there and cover it with some thick material (a stout hessian should do it) and there you go, problem solved.
Does he keep it loopy? If he keeps it loopy, it's all honor, appreciated, it's all love, appreciated. So let your son be wavy, as long as he keeps it loopy. He might end up being the silver surfer in the flesh. You don't want to stifle his creativity, now do you?
waves are the wave of the future. 
He sounds Loopy. 
Ah yes, another one of those new wave devotees 
Sometimes you read something that is just so good, so punny, that you want to smash your head through a wall. 
This is that something
[Make him watch this vid to snap him out of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rT2oUk8wb4)
Is his phase speed the same as his group velocity? If that's the case he should be fine bc that identifies a kelvin wave and Jesus was a zero-modal kelvin wave himself. 

In fact, I think your son is the next messiah. 
Check to see what his internet friends think. He might just be doing this because it's trendy.
Interrupt his flow by an object.
Are you sure it's not a cos?
You should cross post to /r/shittyaskscience for more advice.
Are you sure it isn't a cosin?
You have to let him resonate into the function he is destined to become. Let him spread his angle and begin a new ray of his own.
Hate to go off on a tangent, but you might want to cosine on a separate apartment for him, see if he can function on his own in the field.
You'll be okay, I won't hurt you, you're a good man, bad mans will hurt you, I will now proceed to lie to you like I did Samantha.

Now that standard procedure is out of the way, have you checked his temperature yet?
Bro, stop telling people my wave is your son, okay?
This place is a great medium for these kinds of puns
He might be a little of both.
Or send him to the beach, maybe he'll Tan wave!
This happens way too often. Do you know of anyone that can stop this from happening again?
Yeah, you have to be accepting now. After all, it is the new era of Destruction, prejudice like this is just wrong.
I think that it is a
    
       Vaporwave
I think we can do better. Tau about it?
Yeezy Yeezy what's good?
speak for yourself! In my universe all the waves move from past to future, so they're all waves from the past
so true
Stop going on tangents, you already said everything we needed to know.
He could, if he tried to integrate, and get rid of that negativity
So, a photon? 
I think not but let's be real or at least a sub space within the nth dimension 
time is more fluid than the waves of the waves of the future, past and present. 
Or anything so far as I can tell.
I mean he was always considered bright...

Night after night, a jackal-faced god invades my dreams and whispers eldritch secrets. He gives me the instructions to build a grand tomb, an eternal stone monument of death like the pharaohs of old. He makes some good points, but I'm worried it's just another pyramid scheme. What should I do?
whats the worst thing that could happen?
Build it upside down, turning it into a reverse funnel system. So any payout he would receive actually goes to you.
Why would you build a pyramid when all the cool kids are building sphinxes these days?

I concur. It's a pyramid scheme. Avoid it like the plague.

For future reference: a lot of nasties convey wisdom through ugly fear. It's important to tune out the sizzle actively and see the steak. Imagine the jackal as a guy in a seersucker suit, white patent shoes, and all the other signs of sales bravado. Hear the eldritch secrets as if they were in a Minnesotan accent.

I made a cake for my birthday and proceeded to split it evenly between me and my friends. I do not exist and neither do my friends. Thus, the cake was divided by 0 and the universe now consists solely of cake.
I hate it when that happens. Do you know how many millenniums it’s going to take to fix that?
Happy Birthday!

Your universe is you.

Everything is cake.

You are cake universe.

Happy Birthday to you!

Sorry about your friends though, may they rest in a piece.
Hey, typing non-existent cake. Sentient cake. It was foretold...
Which universe is this? I can certainly take care of your cake problem.
This does not sound like a problem to me...

I have a similar problem, I split my cake between me and my imaginary friend and now we have (1-i)/2 of a cake each, but I have no idea what to do with the imaginary part of my complex cake and feel like I am in some disadvantage in this whole situation.
Here's an easy trick to make 0/0 = 2

```
0/0 = (4-4)/(4-4)
= [(2+2)*(2-2)]/[2*(2-2)]
= (2+2)/2
= 4/2
= 2
```

You have two cakes
Siri is that you??
Oh, I’ve been through this before. You just got to divide it again by the inverse fraction. Just make sure the cake and frosting are reversed this time.
Finally, enough cake to feed my hunger
And this is a problem... why?
Most of us readers don't exist either. So no one is reading this!

You think therefore you are. thus cake should have divided by one instead. retrace your steps as you made them and correct the error. this should rectify your problem(assuming of course this is even a real or irrational problem)

But if you don’t exist then how did you make the cake?

That's assuming i think. I do not think as i am but a concept in your head.
I ordered the cake to make itself.
I am cake now, but i used to be nothing.
It's nice having someone to not exist with.
No. If you look closely you can see every atom is in fact a microscopic cake.
It would be difficult importing cheese since the universe is already full of cake.
That became cake too and no longer functions correctly.

Light is faster than sound, but sound is louder than light and it doesn't get the recognition it deserves and that makes me sad.
But also light is shinier than sound.

Light: +2

Agree, light is very overrated imo
Light can get very loud from where I am. Especially during a headache
Try turning the sound down? Seems like an easily fixable problem if you ask me.
Way to just totally fucking ignore Æther.
[Phonons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon)  would like a word with you.
Not every sound is loud
Sound doesn't even exist. It is an illusion caused by vibrations in up to the third dimension. Light has more fans cause it's actually relevant beyond the third dimension

Is sound louder than light, if its light being sucked into a balckhole?  Or is light louder than sound since there couldn't be sound in a blackhole?
Can I repost this to r/shittyshowerthoughts?
# Sound can be expressed in the form of light as well

# Light: +2

# Sound: +∞
Also light is a transversal wave so its easier to draw.
Light +3
Sound +1
But it does have particle-wave duality
Can you imagine living in the fourth dimension and being limited by such slow speeds??
Yes, I know some of those words
**Phonon**

In physics, a phonon is a collective excitation in a periodic, elastic arrangement of atoms or molecules in condensed matter, specifically in solids and some liquids. Often designated a quasiparticle, it represents an excited state in the quantum mechanical quantization of the modes of vibrations of elastic structures of interacting particles.

Phonons play a major role in many of the physical properties of condensed matter, such as thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity. The study of phonons is an important part of condensed matter physics.

Absolutely, you filthy karma whore you :D
Oh holy shit you’re right
But you cant graph it. Sound is sin(x+tan(x))
Nerrrrrd
Aren't you particle-wave dual? I kinda just assumed every being was PWD
But light can be expressed in the form of sound too.

No that’s only in aether dimensions and such
Ignorance is bliss
This is the greatest debate of all time
There is a man without a face outside the back door holding a bloody suitcase and the memory of a long dead civilisation, I do not know who he is, why he is here or how he got here but I know he is definitely trespassing
Well the good news is he seems to be neutralized. He can't sing you the song of his people without face nor mouth.
He's a salesman.
Then it is legal to shoot him
There is man with no face and a name I don’t remember
Sorry to break code here, but this is one of the coolest sentences I’ve ever read in my life. 10/10.
he wants the manuscripts
If you have telepathy, try asking what dimension he's from. If he's from the Supama dimension, don't tell him to leave. I met him a couple decades ago and he does not take kindly to it.
Thanks odds, he has an existence, you can observe him. Non-existent ones are really çılgın. Ask him to divide his gender with a gender of a blackhole. He will get even more çılgın and will leave you.
Forgive him his trespasses, lest he hold you accountable for yours.

Now put on your game face and climb out of that bloody suitcase. I know you can do it.
KING City, said the paper
Did you try willing him out of existence? It's possible all of this reality is just your lucid dream.
This honestly just feels like a you problem, I don’t know why we’d interfere with that kind man
The briefcase is just full of flies. Relax he's just your average fly salesman.
Hohenheim
Call the cops? Idfk
Just walk up to him slowly and up smash his briecase. Fool will be running in no time.
I know cause i had TWO of them 3 lifetimes ago.
Don't say anything. Its a pyramid scheme.  
First you buy his long dead civilization and then it turns out all they're good for is building pyramids. Eventually all these pyramids just become an eyesore and a public nuisance. You're better off buying a nuclear age civ. The nuclear waste lasts as long as a pyramid, but they bury it out of sight and at least you get some energy out of them for a while. The really good ones blow themselves up after a while so you don't have to take care of them long term.
Servant of the Bones? Nice.  5/7
Slender man
In other news, a man in a tan jacket, holding a deerskin suitcase, was seen. I don't remember anything about him or why this was news, but it had seemed important a the time. I wrote it down: 'Say the important thing about the man in the tan jacket.' What was it? What was I supposed to say?

The man in the tan jacket was running out to the desert. She could just barely see him at the edge of the parking lot's radius of light. His arms were swinging wildly, his suitcase swinging along. His legs were flailing, great puffs of sand kicked up behind him, his head thrown back, sweat running down his face visible even from where she sat. The kind of run that was from something and not toward. Then he left the faint edge of the light and was gone.

Remember that under Castle Doctrine, if he's on your property you're allowed to build a parapet out of him.
This is a reference to Anomalies by Lord Bung, isn't it?
Is he wearing a black hat?
Contact the . enforcement and do not listen  to anything he tells you he preaches only lies do not listen
But ancient songs of forgotten heroes long dead are one of the only methods of payment around here, he better have something else to offer or i'm calling the Foundation!
Interesting, I thought his kind was banished in the War of Heaven around ten thousand cycles ago
But I am filed with indescribable dread whenever I try to
Good luck
Paging Mr. Wake
HOHENHEIM NO—
Ever since the new government LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE! came into being it has been increasingly difficult to contact police
*SCP FOUNDATION, OPEN UP!*
 Hi calling, I'm Dad!
If you look closely at the "blood", you'll find it's not human blood, but tomato blood. The suitcase is filled with spaghetti-o's. You're right, normally this wouldn't be allowed, but there's a strange loophole in the toroidal document on the subject, creating an anomaly where spaghetti-o's can be used for ln(n^2) intentions, where n represents dubiousness. 

To determine if the salesman's intentions are pure, ask him to turn the key in the briefcase's ignition and demonstrate that the spaghetti-o's run and drive. Some leaks should be expected. Ask for the SIN (spaghetti-o identification number) to run a spaghetti-o history report. If it all checks out though, you may have an opportunity to invest in a growing asset!
They've been banished from everywhere now, leaving them eternally travelling with nowhere to stop. No one has yet found a way to both completely and elegantly solve the travelling salesmen problem.
Those are his psychic waves. Ignore them or he'll use them to disable and consume you. Good luck.
Could you be a bit clearer about the type of dread you experienced?
*hi calling the foundation
Hi Dad, I'm Calling!
Let me see, unspecified fear of a threat unclear, terror at the way everything remains superficially as it was before and yet so very different in ways words cannot describe.
Don't actually shoot then. This is a body hopper. You'll just end up shooting yourself.

Good news is, you can just drink a glass of owl milk and be fine.
My local diner started serving "bottomless milkshakes". As a result, an infinite number of boys have been brought to my yard.
This is fixable, albeit at a cost. Tell them that you can, indeed, teach them, but you will have to charge.
What would you say is the second order derivative, the speed, at which these boys come to the yard.

Is is better than mine? Much better than mine?

Because mine is F(x,y) 20x^3 + sin^-1 2y d^2 x d^2 y.
Oh no. It happened again. I had hoped this problem had been lost to time. Oh how foolish I was to hope. 

You see, the problem is not with your yard, nor the boys, but the milkshake production. Unlimited milkshakes sounds fun and dandy, until someone goes too far and makes them. 

You see, there are two kinds of unlimited drinks, refillable, and a version using anti-blackhole technology, or ABT. Most stores just offer free refills. Your local diner went with the later.

ABT is a wonderful yet monstrous thing. You see, the store creates an anti black hole, something that instead of sucking things in with immense gravity, produces matter and light. They are lighter than air, and if you add some substance, like say a taste of milkshake, an infinite amount of that matter is produced. 

After the creation of such a sweet terror, the diner then extracts a small bit of the anti-blackhole, and puts it in a cup. This can lead to other problems, bit ill move on.

ABT can often create particles that need to be balanced. Boys do not lactate, of course, and work as balancers to these ABT created "pure milk particles". The attraction between these two balances is so strong, they are drawn together. This is why the boys are in your yard. 

As for a solution, flee. The Equalizers have been notified. They will solve your problem, but flee. You don't want to be caught in the aftermath. The milk starved zombies, the ice cream floods, and everything else is not fun. Run. Just run. Get out.

TLDR: Get out. Save yourself. Please. 


The milkshakes are being served from a Klein bottle. Find something long and cylindrical to place in the bottle's reciprocal bulbous receiver and it should plug things up nicely.
This can be fixed, however you *MUST* insure that the bird is *NOT* the word. Good luck.
Sooner or later all boys grow tired of diner milkshakes and will yearn for the bosom of their native home. Simply yorhel each of their nostalgic melodies and patron lullaby (preferably concurrently, but you can dividetransform the tunes between a few verses depending on your ability), and they will come off your yard.
Drown them in the milkshakes, try to push them as far down as possible.
I can procure for you, for a nominal fee, an engine powered by the body and soul of a boy.  Given the infinite number you have on hand, you'll never have to pay energy costs again.
[Meta] This paperclip is scaring me :(

Have I angered the great owl?
Just tell the milkshakes to put on some pants
Charge them, and gain an infinite amount of money, then use it to destroy the world economy.
There ain't gonna be no shake without no bottoms. The bottom is *the essence* of the shake. The disappointment will begin shortly.
You have yet to apply the trap card principle, you have to multiply the void by the barnacles and then you have your apple pie!
Those fools have no idea of the [danger](http://www.reddit.com/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/1duxfe/i_went_to_a_restaurant_that_advertised_unlimited/) they are in.

My dairy based frozen confection creates a focal point to which young males of the species are drawn. You are correct: It is far superior to yours. I could attempt to educate you on the finer points of this subject, but it would require monetary compensation on your part.
that's really gonna make Nas jealous. 
God dammit I thought this was an ad for free bottomless milkshakes 
Did you try disconbumblefuckulation?
Tell me more about the milkshake production process
Stop bringing the 'shakes home with you. Their problem, let them deal with it. 
But then if you taught 'em.... 
What if he can't teach them? What if, by the infinite number of boys and thus infinite number of different milkshake formulae, one of them [must] prove to be better than his?
Damn right, it's better than yours. 
Costs too much. 
What if you drink the anti-black hole? Does it start producing the taste in your mouth from last night?
That's what she said.
Ah, the old pigeon-shake principle. 
Its parity is even.
If you drink the anti black hole before adding anything else, well, hopefully it touches some leftover toothpaste, or other swallow-able material. I saw one case where it touched a guys tooth first. It got ugly. Teeth were everywhere. Great for his dentist though. 

So yes, it may indeed give you a retaste of your foods. I would not recommend it, though.
It works out. This is actually the way Xoxar's Perfect Shakes got their penultimate recipe. Amusingly enough after investing an infinite amount of time they realized that the perfect shake was the one that they had all along. Tangentially this is similar to how I got my collection of all art the universe would ever make.

I moved all my files from my C: drive to my D: drive. But now my computer's really sad all of a sudden, what could be wrong with it?
Make a hard symlink on the C: drive pointing to the D: drive. I know, I know, lying is bad, but as long as it doesn't know it'll stay happy.
Try the :D drive instead.
You need to post this to /r/ShittyTechSupport.
I partitioned my porn in my O: drive and now my computer has frozen.
It's because you lowered your drive's grade. Computers do not like to underachieve. It would make your computer extremely happy to change your D: drive to an A+: drive.
Better than moving it to your S: drive. All my files are corrupted now.
Ya little whippersnapper! Back in my day we had to deal with the dreaded B: drive. It was a friggin' neanderthal, by gum!
This is a really simple fix. All you need to do is add ((((( ))))))

Every day.
Have you tried using a plunger? sometimes the usb and other ports on the back of a computer get clogged up with data juice and that juice must be expressed and the best way to do that is with a plunger.
Have you tried turning it off and on?
I would suggest the ¥: drive, but it can get a little annoying if you don't like trumpets. 
You need to give it the D to make it a :3 drive.
Try the I: drive. It'll be annoyed, but not as sad. Stay away from the E: drive. I still haven't gotten the bite marks out of my files.
Relying too much on the D: is never a smart thing.
Don't move your files to the X: drive. I did that and now my computer's speakers don't work.
I'll tell you something. In situations like this, a man can either abort, or he can retry, or he can fail?
You can install Linux, but your computer may turn into a nerdy butthurt dweller.

You can buy a Mac, but it's likely to start acting like it's much better than you.
You made me nostalgic for my Windows days. XD
Must move from saddest key's drive. Have you tried a drive with a brighter tone?
Because it's running Windows.
Just move them to your E: drive and your computer will definitely not turn into a catboy
Stop being a bad mans
Try your Z: drive, it works better for me
This is only true of Asian HDDs.
Bad idea. He'll get furballs all over the place. And, assuming he doesn't know much about computers, he probably doesn't know how to unpack a .fur.gz file.
[deleted]
How about Asian SSDs?
Yes, a computer running Windows. 
Those don't support grades lower than B: anyway. 
You're confused. Computers don't run.
Ive now lived through 13 universe cycles, but by my ability to distort gravity hasn't manifested. Is this normal for extradimensional puberty?
It really depends, I know I wasn’t able to distort gravity until about 17 universe cycles, for some beings it never even kicks in, for most however it occurs during the later cycles of extradimenaional puberty, you should get there soon, don’t worry!
Wait, you guys can distort gravity?
I got my ability to distort gravity after consuming a black hole every 2000 years for 3 universe cycles
Just distort timespace, the gravity will come
Have you been eating healthy? Getting all your vitamins and not binging on Dark Matter? 

An unbalanced diet can delay your maturation cycle. Binging on Chocolate, Dark Matter, or even virgin sacrifices can be detrimental to your health. Keep a steady diet and exercise schedule, even if this isn't why you're not manifesting. A healthy entity is a happy entity.
mmm... I'd say 13 is a little young for gravitational manipulation. Most higher dimensional beings can barely contain a wormhole at that age. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Enjoy your youth while you have it. Being in charge of spacetime and quantum tunneling isn't all fun and games you know.
Distortion of gravity becomes easier the more spacetime you are responsible for. As more universe cycles pass, you'll be given free reign over more spacetime. It'll probably take a few more cycles. Don't be too disappointed, I'm sure you'll get the chance to do so soon enough!
What is happening? Where is this place? I witnessed the end and it was beautiful. Am I now to begin anew?
Try reincarnating some NEETs
no
Give it some time, I didn't even get my third eye by the time I was in my eighth cycle and other than a few stunted tendrils I came out fine!
Sorry, Made in Heaven and C Moon are mutually exclusive
Haha I could distort gravity at 9! Look at this loser, bet he can’t manifest yet either. No interdimensional girl will like you. Could on guys let’s are his lunch money even though it has no value to us, as lunch is such a 1D construct and money is the relic of a system that has value
Ah, okay. The primary problem here is that a lot of different people have opted for a lot of different blueprints. Can you give me the name of your creator(s)?

Edit: I'm assuming you come from the same place as OP, btw.
It took me 16 universe cycles to be able to distort gravity, I think it may vary according to what you have done in the universe. I also met a guy, I will try to create the name using my keyboard. Лoン古bпй   You spell it like "Hakydorme" and he said it took 21 years to be able to distort gravity, and 59 years to be able to get in other people's existance.
[removed]
Did the primordial [CORRUPTED] not have "the talk" with you?
Shhhhh! They don't know they're in a simulation!
Well that doesn't seem very healthy, you shouldn't be consuming any singularities before your 10th cycle, I hope you take care of yourself better
Ooh, careful of this one. High-exotic-particle diets aren't well-understood yet. A lot of people say they help you bulk up, but a lot of people have a friend of a friend whose kid suffered M-brane damage from them.
Exactly! I’m only 21, and I already miss not having to spend 8 galactic rotations per black hole lifespan rolling dice to decide whether a particle will tunnel or not. Sure, it’s fun to prank mortals by making their TV remote teleport to the middle of nowhere, but that’s basically the only good part of my duty. Well, at least I’ll be done with this by the 65th cycle and can live the rest of my lifespan before I am reborn in another reality. But wow, back when I was 13, existence was so much easier.
How??? All of that in just a tinynfraction of a cycle?

The extra dimensional overlord does not appreciate that word. You have five solar cycles to cease usage.
No :(
Shhhhh! Now they know they're in a simulation!
My cycle that I met that guy was actually much much longer than normal cycles. O thing his ability to get in people's existances caused that. The same thing might happened to him more than once.
Thank you for the request, comrade.

I have looked through thebiggayanon's posting history and found 4 N-words, of which 3 were hard-Rs.

Elder God here. My disciples suffered a 100-year famine and remained faithful so I deemed them worthy of receiving my bountiful gifts of bread, fish and vitality. I proclaimed, however, "Time to eat children!" instead of "Time to eat, children" resulting in the evisceration of every child under 7.
I fail to see the issue here. This sounds great and it seems that you did everything correctly and efficiently achieved the desired result, the evisceration of every child under 7! Carry on and don't forget to pat yourself on the "back" for a job well done! Honestly, I think the real challenge will be ensuring the evisceration of every child above, to the left, and to the right of 7.
Ah well. That happens to everybody. (Don't even ask me what pandas eat.) You shouldn't worry about the Elder Elder Gods either, they were once young and... no, I don't mean *young*... but in their adoles... early da...

Time is without meaning to them, but in an eon when they paid attention to the vain whine of seconds, they too spake as stutterings of flame and mumblings of cave wind, and were witness to fevered confusions of the mortal chaff and the mayfly lords. Truly it was not their will their will should be natural law; and their words were not always the thinnest scalpels of purpose. They were capable of... allowing... they sometimes... err...  interpretation of their words.

None still stay in any semblance of life that can speak of that lost dark eon, but it once was, though impenetrable vast gulfs of separation, uh, separate us from it.

What I'm saying is, chill as the grave chills its morsels; the el-elders can be pretty cool.
I leave you alone for just ONE moment (define moment yourself) and you this kind of stuff? Enjoy having grammar guides rain on you when you leave your house. 

And your disciples know things apparently better than you, so I'm revoking your privileges of commanding them for 5 eons. Learn to be a better leader.
Ah, I remember the first time that happened, I was also worried about what the Even Greater Older Ones would think as well, but as it turns out they understand the difficulty of a first cult as well and would probably let you off with a warning and only part of your soul, although it is probably smart to lay low for a few eons afterwards
Quick side question: how did you land your Elder God job? I’ve had my theodominance certificate for over a year and the only openings I can find are for ruling over a random sea, or driving a sun around a planet in a chariot or something. I trained for more though! I want to foist upon the mortals a global pestilence, or make a quarterback throw more accurately for a day.
Outlaw any sort of contraception then have them all gather in a super-hot-orgy-fuck-fest. Get repopulated in no time, add that coma sometime though so it doesn't happen again.
Most probably for the best, as the lack of children will put less strain on your matured disciples. Have faith and consult the ancient ones if you’re truly concerned, but I wouldn’t worry too much about it.
This will really skew the average age of new residents in Q-2136, but there are still more than enough thorny tooth-bats available, so I fail to see the problem here.
You can still spin this in a positive light to the Elder Elder Gods. They have to be well versed in the pitfalls of human language (like the Oxford Comma, for instance), just tell them you were teaching your human subjects/adherents a lesson in specificity and the importance of good grammar.
Don't worry about it, just declare a death orgy and your disciples will make more
That happened to me once, good times.
Translation errors happen when trying to communicate with beings who can perceive fewer than 14 dimensions. You know better for next time. Live and learn for all eternity, what else can you do?
Better than the last time that happened.

>I told their leader not to drink the Flavoraid and get out while he could. 

Yeah, Jonestown didn’t go so well.
Ignorance is indubitably indelible. Fortunately, there are History Erasers in the Perfect Realm.
i see no problem here
That's a bit embarrassing, but it happens to everyone from time to time. Just act like that's what you intended to happen and you should be fine. The only thing likely to be a problem would have been seeming like you don't control your worshipers.
Go back in time and give them goats as substitutes. I assure you, this will result in only killing the ill behaved ones first. It worked for Jehovah.
Resurrect said children and give them minor powers as show of your power? TBH this is hilarious. Keep me posted. As in literally post me. I'm lost. Help.
They were doing that during the famine. They went ham on the kids because they'd always felt guilty about it, but now you've given them tacit approval.
Honestly you goofed and you should own it.  Get in one last good smite, hold it in your mouthparts, and savor it.
We have heard.  We do not care about the mortals.  Continue as normal.
In your defense, it can be hard to phonetically convey a comma, but nobody said life was fair
Yeah, I can't help you with this one
If nothing else, you can take comfort in the fact that your minions are among the most vile in creation. Well done.
You know... we aren’t mad, just disappointed...
Classic
???
man, and you'd think you woulda caught that too, what with untold eons to consider the plan
I’m not seeing the problem
> under 7! 

Uh-oh that's now everyone under 5040. This could be bad.
I mean the elder gods never told you \*not\* to eviscerate all children. If they didn't want that they should've specified
Yeah this should have been posted to r/fifthworldhumblebrag
This gives me no comfort at all. If what you're saying is true, they could inadvertently curse me with some execrable fate, far worse than even *they* intended. Imagine they  intended to decree "your ass is toast for a while" but instead a typo corrupted their command to "your ass is toast for a whale". The prospect of an inferno erupting from my rectal region bad enough, but imagine myself merely relegated to some cetacean's breakfast?
Nooo ;\_;
Pardon my misspeaking. They exist before the Perfect Realm.
Damn factorials always ruining my eldritch ventures.
Yes, that could be bad. It won't be easy to eviscerate that many children manually... I think you're going to need to begin installing automated, factory style, mass evisceration facilities or you'll be at it forever ("forever" in the mortal sense, not the eldritch sense, of course).
r/unexpectedfactorial
I agree! Eviscerate all living things just to be safe. Better to be safe rather than sorry in cases like this.
Only your *ass* would be the whale's breakfast, though. I imagine you have many of them, much like most eldritch creatures, and they would use "ass" singular in their decree.
Moreover, you could simply relegate the problem to an Equus asinus. If the elder-elders are that irresponsible to make simple typos, they would not be particularly specific in their curses, either.
I've mistakenly looked a gift horse in the mouth and I saw what we're all getting for Christmas. How can I forget it so I'm still surprised in December?
Mouth the gift horse in the look, this should create an anti-memory which will cancel with your current memory of these gifts. In my dimension, Christmas is 2,457,862 days away, so I’d have forgotten anyways, but I’m glad to help others who may not be so fortunate with their calendars.
I'm surprised no one here has provided the correct answer: You need to flood your arbitrator with cesium extract. This is the ONLY way to expunge these memories from your conflation engine. Otherwise, you'll be caught in a taxon-time loop (Haitcheson 20019) and there's no escaping that.
The most important question: How to make sure your mother in law doesn't get the brand new Mercedes.
••|•••••|••|• helps sometimes
What works for me is to get inside the horse and look the gift horse out of the mouth.
> December

Oh, *that* Christmas?
I mean you can theoratucally Perform a memory purge on yourself...

Or you know.. Act surprised. Worked with me
Dissociate back into the fourth world
Implying that we have any clue what your local probability constants are. You'll need to repeat the process with deliberation instead of doing so mistakenly and then confirm which of the gifts change.
As the Elders will tell you, memory is not a corridor of moving pictures from past to present, but a meadow one wanders through. Lead the herd of gift horses far away in that meadow, to graze on sights unremembered. As long as you stay in the light, and shy away from the things you *must* forget, everything will be okay. 

Oh, and don't leave the meadow. No matter what you hear in the forest.
You must grow past the outdated concept of "December". It's been disproven over and over again, believing in it is just idiotic
Earth grade amnestics
Ø
Kill the horse, and then there will be no presents.
I'm no aviator of memories, but I would say your best bet is to find that gift horse and vomit in its mouth. Hopefully it will be excepting of taking the memory back.

Best of luck.
Lock the horse in a Schrodinger Box. Then when you open it... Surprise!
Get a hickey from the gift horse and you will forget everything.
Damn, I wish you'd have arrived sooner. I was close, but I foolishly gifted the horse a mouth and now he won't stop his incantations

It's okay, if you followed his advice, the resulting memory anti memory explosion would have destroyed roughly 27.2% of the timeline.
I was trying to create a universe with one god and a billion mortals, but due to a rounding error, it instead has a billion gods and one mortal
Probably. As long as Jeff stays alive, the gods will think that Jeff is actually the god and them the ordinary beings. After he dies... Nobody can tell what will happen.
Depends - is Jeff an atheist?
Dude this would be a pretty nice thing to try and put on the writingprompts subreddit
Jeff is my god
/╲/\\╭( ͡° ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ͡°)╮/\\╱\\

&#x200B;

Hand over all spaghetti!

\- Jeff
Just recalculate, and don't round in the © direction this time. They'll swap positions willingly, and Jeff will be the one true god.
Lol, nope.  Eventually one of your gods will figure out the first one to kill Jeff wins his soul, and Jeff is officially and completely fucked once that happens.
Are you gods dependent on Jeff's worship to stay alive?
Stephen, is that you?
Welp he's going to be really spoiled by the gods. I don't think they will let him die though... He's probably going to become inmortal with a LOT of blessings...  Normally in this type of situations the being starts to become superior to the gods with so many blessings (becoming the real god there) after a while the specimen who cannot be spoken as a mortal any more transcends his origin universe and starts to create his own universes.
Jeff is The God Of Normality
Is Jeff aware of each Gods rules? Will Jeff begin writing gospels for them, if so- he may need a library.... Jeff may need to learn carpentry to build said Library.....
Just simulate reality around him. To save on space, don’t render anything he can’t see and instead run background interpolations to fill in the sensory void. Sure, everyone he knows and loves ceases to exist once they leave his sight, but he’ll never know any better.
If you live within a distance of the sector #FF405B1138 then collapse your universe or the remaints of jeff are going to do permanent damage to your tissue
If the gods are dependent on Jeff's worship to survive, then they'll all being promising him stuff like political candidates to try and win his favour. 

And then Jeff becomes the god....
Some god's can create mortal beings. But eventually, they might get bored of making them all the same, or just sticking them all in the same place. If youre a god of planetary bodies, you might be able to travel to other galaxies, so why not see what else will work? Just plunk some amino acids on an asteroid, and send it out to the nearest moon spewing organic matter. They'll take some time to evolve, but if you are immortal, just take a nap. Before you know it, theyre using tools, which is the perfect time to introduce yourself. 

Unfortunately, this process sometimes end up with entire planets that, over time, develop lethal infestations of parasitic humans.
Succs for that dude lmao
That's what all that noise was last night. Could barely lucid dream
Poor mortal
I smell a writing prompt
Simple, just make a super god and have the gods and Jeff follow it. I'd recommend something out of the latest Eldritch catalogue, to prevent uprisings.
Jeff will be fine. In the grand scheme of things, it's barely off
Jeff is fucked. Good luck Jeff! we are all rooting for you.
Like a trailer for a short sci fi story
Jeff's death might be seen as transcendence by the gods - only deepening their faith in Him.
Jeff is currently 18% of the way through his natural lifespan and has begun questioning all that he was taught as a child. The gods, paranoid of being forgotten, have begun taking extreme action against Jeff, causing him to doubt them all the more.

So, maybe agnostic?
Thanks for the idea! I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/despaw/wp_in_this_universe_there_was_supposed_to_be_one/) :)
Jeff is perfectly capable of and willing to kill himself thank you very much
Regrettably, yes. I tried to sit Jeff down at a local library and teach him the Names of the Billion Gods so that they may never die.

Sadly, he couldn't stop screaming.
Ah, what an optimistic outlook! A █████ to call my very own.

You know how it goes, though. After an infinite amount of time has passed and the Old Gods have grown old, they'll expect Jeff to take care of them. And that's just a hassle for everyone involved.
The average among the average among the average
And if you *really* wanna mess with him, allow him to have lucid dreams while asleep. Maybe even throw in a few dreams-within-dreams, Inception-style! That'll really fuck with his psyche!
I think you mean the trailer to the backwash park of this dimension. What cellular made organism would want to watch that cosmic garbage am we right guys?
That's one possibility, yes.
Sounds like Jeff is going to be spoiled a lot by the Gods.
So if he forgets the gods, do they cease existing? If so, how would he remember all 1 billion gods. Is he actually a god? Did he turn into a god out of necessity? Did the gods do him so many favors that he became a overpowered human? Am i getting confused? Is existence even real?
No problem man. I was gonna make it, but I thought,"you know what, this man made it, so he deserves it."
Then it is the gods who must fear Jeff.

For Jeff is a wrathful mortal.

I broke my good China and now 1 billion people are dead
find buddha, he'll sort you out.
Ok, I think I can help you out, but first, you need to find your good Mongolia. Then, shatter that. This could reverse the effects of history when the Mongolians slaughtered millions of Chinese, and that amount of people might be able to reproduce to the point where a billion more people are present in China. You'd have to kill the Mongolians, but whatever. 
I have an extra China I could sell you cheap. It's probably not as good as yours was. It's been infested with communism. But it could be fixed up easily enough. Truth is, I'd like to get rid of it and get a second Canada, so I'll accept any reasonable offer.
Unplug it and plug it back in
Just buy new China. Nobody will notice the difference.
No going back now.  Might as well have a Turkey sandwich.
See if your Taiwan can fix your good China.
Lay eggs and birth another billion people, obviously. It isn't difficult.
Nothing that hasn't happened to China before.
That's nothing. I once [hit an entire freaking plateau](http://www.reddit.com/r/fifthworldproblems/comments/qtgar/ive_been_losing_weight_steadily_but_now_ive_hit_a/) resulting in a near extinction event.
So did you try turning it off and turning it on again?
What about bad china? Listen, we need to know what just happened. There is no time.
Too bad, just try not to replicate North Korea, the repercussions usually don't end we'll for me. Geberally along the lines of raspberry-flavored nuclear holocausts...
Just upload your China from a second or third level ontology and you should be fine, barring any of the usual effects of reality substitution.
Don't worry. It's nothing that super glue can't fix.
You must be water my friend.
Are you sure it was real China?  Or was it a cheap Chinese knockoff?
Just glue it back together until you can find a more permanent solution.
That's better than the [piece of china](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) I have. There's almost 24 million bacteria on it. 
Try to avoid meeting the Buddha on a road, so you aren't obligated to kill him.

If you find The Buddha on the road, kill him.

I hate to say this but I think we all have to acknowledge the elephant in the Room, his name is Geoffrey and he hasn't been getting the recognition he deserves for preventing both the Abyss and the Void from spilling into it
IIRC, he prefers Geoff since the incident.
Thank you, Geoffrey!
Namaste, Ganesh.
[deleted]
Praise to the Room. There are no other rooms, only the Room and Geoff is his prophet.
Geoffrey? I must be in the wrong plane of existance, the elepahnt in the room here seems to be called "pink" and responds rather angerily to being called Geoffrey
Big G is our anchor in this limbo
Are you talking about the employee of the month or just some random 6th dimensional elephant?
I mean I never commanded the Abyss to try to seap into the world, let me see if I can fix that for you.
he fell on some hard times after Tiys R Uswent out of business he could use some recognition!
You rock, Geoffrey!
Geoff is a soft boi
How do you guys do the REDACTED black redactions?
OK, John Oliver
Is he a hellephant?
Ok that’s freaky..... I wrote about the elephant in the room called Gerald last week in an essay.... don’t ask
Never really gotten to know Geoff. Could tell what happened? ~~OOTL~~ Out of the Mobius Strip

**EDIT:** clarification
Sorry, I haven't been to the Room ever since the barbecue so I didn't know that anything happened
ORE WA GANESHA DA

Sorry, too much Danmachi
That's the snake Geoffrey, the elephant Geoffrey likes compliments but doesn't get them because people get him confused with the serpent
All other rooms were torn apart by Lisa
Yes, don’t instigate any parades.  What’s wrong with you, yo?
Employee of the month obviously, and employee of the eternity as well!
On the other hand, I'll let the void know it has a gas leak
Wrong Geoffrey, that is a the L O N G  O N E
It's kind of personal... don't you know how to traverse time?
On the contrary. Appropriate Danmachi.

sorry, i ran out of time a while back.  not really sure how to get it back.
Don't worry, very easy mistake
It is very fair, Geoff is a hard worker!
But I wanted to be employee of the eternity! I mean, I became a 10th dimensional being and everything!

I guess you just can't beat Geoff...
My son identifies as a crescent moon. I’m worried, but my wife says it’s just a phase.
Moonness is a spectrum. All moons are a little bit crescent, and insisting that you're a red-blooded full moon suggests that you might just be suppressing your latent crescentness. 
Oof
The real problem is gonna be whom your son gravitates toward.  
It may sound cheesy but there is a real dark side to that joke.

Just tossed a coin because I needed to decide between two shirts and thought a 50/50 set of odds would be fair. The coin landed on a crack on the street standing up, and now I have chosen both and neither at once, and I think time space is splitting into a paradox of opposites.
You really should have should not have kicked not kicked the coin not-coin without while looking at it. Oh well. You'll just have to travel back forward in time space to fix break it.
Cut the shirts in half and sew them together so the front of your body is covered by one shirt and the back is covered by the other. You now are abiding by both actions and the coin being stuck upright.
Just give it a bit. Let it run its course. If you wind up in the same spot you should be fine. However, there is a slight chance that you will wind up in a room with a weird entity in the corner. Don't acknowledge it, just state that you wish you and some change right about now.
No game no life vibes
This is going to rip the fabric of each shirt's reality in half, great, now you have 4 shi's, you fashionable fellow!
Hol up... you mean you tossed a coin and it *FELL*??? ***ARE YOU ON A WORLD WITH GRAVITY???***
Oh this brings me back. In my youth this happened to me once. I flipped a coin and became two as the coin became its two eventualities. The heads me is the me typing, the tails me tried to fight me the second he was free. He talked in a strange accent, at times I had no idea what words or phrases he was uttering, but carnal memories bubbled to the surface in understanding with every arcane gasp. I cut him down quickly, too afraid to bear witness of what he might bring about to the world, to fate, to reality.

However, something always claws at the back of my mind. There's a possibility of a third eventuality in a coin. Nearly impossible, yes. But there's however slim a chance that the coin lands exactly on its side.

Since that realization, I've yet to sleep soundly.
Ta'avern strikes again
Wait what day of the week is it there? If it’s a Wednesday you’re doomed and I cannot help you. If it’s the 8th Thursday of Smishmarchuary there’s a simple fix for your problem.
I'd look into getting a Schrödinger's cat. By setting up a parallel paradox, you could cause a paradoxical singularity, erasing the original paradox, and leaving you with only 1 choice, and 1 timeline.
Community?
Why were you deciding which shirt to wear in the street? Anyway, you have to make the coin bounce from the crack back into your hand to reverse the events that happened after the flip! Quickly! I'm either being reborn or fading out of existence! I can't tell!
Pics or it didn't happen
schrodinger head ass
Sigh... Did you try turning space time off and on again?
Honestly, you should've just wore both shirts, smh
Be.
Awful awesome! I'm fucked saved!
This almost fixed it! I'm still inhabiting in a split between two timelines though.
What's gravity?
It's frerfday
I knew someone would say it. Those third-dimensionals may be limited, but that doesn’t mean that the things that they create aren’t beautiful.
I was going leaving home and tossed not tossed the coin because I was going not going out in for lunch fasting.
Problem is. Cameras measure results. Since we are fucking with quantum mechanics, you'll only see one result and everything will seem normal. I am living in a Schrödinger's Cat situation.

Oof.

My girlfriend got called a basic bitch so she took some acid and is now a neutral bitch. Is this an optimal state to occupy from a chemical standpoint?
She should also try and find a perfect balance between sweet and salty.
Well, assuming she's a regular run of the mill cephalopod, she should ideally be in the 8-9pH range, so more on the alkaline side. That said, if she keeps taking more acid, it's likely she'll be able to slip into a dimension where that isn't true. Her call 🐙
Beware she might turn sour. That could be corrosive to your relationship. Give her pumpkin spice latte as needed.
Basically, yes. 
Better than being a caustic bitch, I suppose.
Just as long as she doesn't take too much acid. Then it'll be a Tums festival
Post acid is a very ideal state
Watch out. She could be a little salty now.
If she's a human, yeah. Although she will want to clear out the excess salt. A fluorine-water solution should do the trick
It depends, you need to put her at the pH where she forms a zwitterion, that’s their preferred state. 
Add some mdma to her regimen, see if that makes her less of a bitch
There's actually zero difference between being basic or acidic. You idiot. You fucking moron.
Stop trying to eat my girlfriend I told you she's not on the menu 
I prefer my bitches to be incendiary.
Better salty than basic. Trying to get her to perform chemical reactions was impossible when she was basic, she just kept saying "I can't even"

Sure, but if I remember my basics correctly she probably felt *slippery* to the touch.

Nah that's just how her scales make her look. She's only slippery when wet

I applied for student loans, but now I have way more students than I know what to do with. What should I do with all my students?
Hiiiii! Julia from Marketing here! I've been authorized to grant you the deal of an unlife/partlife/regularlifetime! For every 71 students you trade to us, we'll give you a single intern. It takes 71 students to congeal into a single intern, you know. Once an intern has properly incubated and matured, they make for a great topping on shaved ice! And seriously, you've goooot to try the shaved ice. Your existence literally depends on it. Byeeee!
Send them places so you can see distant locations through them. They *are* your pupils now, aren't they?
r/fifthworldlegaladvice
Compound their interest by signing them up for liberal arts degrees.
This is my favourite sub on reddit.
Make a meat dragon.
Students typically are too lean to serve as a main course, but with a nice rich gravy they can be a pretty decent entree.
The most important thing you can do with your college students right now is to know about them. These students will go on to attend jobs that will need their skills. Students do not have enough time to study before work or after school.

In my previous job, it took me four weeks to figure out how to organize the files you see in this article into a system. I would have had to fill out paperwork to get any kind of help. If you are new to college, your first class of the new semester will bring in thousands of files so this is a great opportunity for you to start.

I recently had these students apply for a government job. They were working part time jobs, they were in high school only. When an interview comes up, I know I have to know what their situation is. How far in the process are they willing to take? Or how would they like to see their resume put together?
Buy dogs. Give a tribute to the gods
I usualy just loan them out
Give them to kalistanxran the devourer of souls and hell give you a special deal. I personally devour their souls myself but it's up to you
Well, if you can get Shakespeare out of a room full of monkeys with typewriters, imagine what you can get out of a room full of students with sporks.
Have you tried giving the unused students back?  It might help pay down your principal.
Just overcharge them for tuition and make them fail graduation, then you can return them and keep the money!
By default, you should default on the loan.
Ummmm slave labor obviously
Give them sauerkraut
Test out some experimental Poetry on them.
Studies have shown that people who work in STEM tend to contribute far more value than what they get paid. Require all your students to pursue STEM fields. Return the ones who fail so you save on interest. If any are interested in business, encourage them to study actuarial science. Then you get professional advice from them rather than asking people in anonymous online forums.
Give them all 20 hundred lives or things could go different
Well, depending on the interest rate, I'd recommend starting to breed them fairly quickly. You definitely want a good enough return that you end up with some students at the end of your term.
Cremate them
Teach them mortality and they’ll all die then you won’t have all those students

I’m having some beef with my coworker and was asked to square up, but I’ve been having trouble simplifying myself from my tesseract form. How do I cube up, and from there, square up?
Talk to an Orthonormal Projectionist.

:)
Try drinking a glass of square root tea. It should bring you to yourself multiplied by yourself.
“Square up” is a technique used by lower dimensional beings. What you need is to “square down”.  You can find lots of references on the subject if you start from the right search keywords.
[deleted]
Cut your beef into cubes and then slice that into squares.
"Square Up" is actually a term used by one-dimensional beings - They are referring to the process of going from a line to a square. What you actually need to do is cube down, and from there square down.

Alternatively, you could request that your coworker cube up (no balls, he won't).
Try some root beer
After cubing up, the only way to square up is to actually show up at the fight. Once you show up, you will be able to square up, because once you’re there, you’re square. 

Hope this helps.
You need to differentiate yourself. Use shortcuts and check your work with the definition so you don't warp your figure
Don't bring yourself down to his dimension.
You have to derive yourself, be sure to avoid drinking beforehand, though. The dx's easily become dy's while inebriated, and that'll be awful for your gut microbes.
choose an axis along which to  level with him. you are never going to come back from the transformations you mentioned, and there is risk of making the beef toxic.
You have to go around it to truely see his shape
Assuming you're still symetrical You cast a shadow on a volume, don't ask me how i'm not sure, but you're cubed up now, but once you've got this quasi-crystal you cast another shadow on any surface. Boom, squared up.
It's easier than you might expect.

Oberve, it is hip to be square. This is a transitive property, and thus, it is square to be hip. If you go to your nearest biological transformation center, (they're *literally* everywhere now) you can become any kind of hip you'd like (a hip is a biological structure among tetrapodal animals on eeeeeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrttttttttthhhhhhhhh and also earth.)

In becoming a hip, you will become square as well. And technically you'll be squaring down.
What is happening? Where is this place? I witnessed the end and it was beautiful. Am I now to begin anew?
Square *UP* not square *down*, you imbecile. They're asking you to double your exponent. Whatever it is you already are, square yourself again!

you = x^^y

what they want = (x^^y ) ^^2 = x^^2y
You may need to round it up.
You could derive yourself twice, that should work
This is technically a 4th dimensional problem. However, you should be able to talk to a Orthonormal Projectionist, they know their stuff.
Y'ould always braise it with celery powder, salt, garlic, onion and 3 cubes of ice. Makes the tesseract tender, and coworkers more flavourful.
Brb going to find my ti84
I believe the term is "slang" from the 4.5th world. I think the definition is to simply telekinetically draw a square using neon particles.
make sure the beef is fully cooked, I find that it helps deteriorate yourself
I’d hate to be the actual square here but from a philosophical and actual point of view everything has been evolving for the same length of time. 

What you would have to do is eat of the Parasite-Kraken. That creature has been around for 5 universes and this universe has imparted a nutty flavour.
This would take as an infinite amount of time, however, you can still accomplish it if you make it into a supertask
[deleted]
If you really want to get him, tell him he’s square-root and not worth your time.
and i’ll try some lung ankle hehehehehe
I find a sprinkle of longwave really helps subdue that nuttyness while also giving the benefits of one of your daily Г̡͞д̶̴̛͞г̧̕ю̷̵́͘а̵̢͘͘͜л̶̢а̷̵̧͝͏й͠ which of course is necessary.
What about eating of the Elder Gods themselves? Bacon from Horace, the protector god would taste heavenly, I'm guessing, though you'd be going straight to hell or equivalent if you actually went to obtain it.
Noone said this task wasnt time constrained?  Don't push OP to the limit now....
When using planes on the cubes just be careful to not shave too thin.  Noone likes paper steak.
Supertasks make it possible within a constrained amount of time. I believe our lord and savior Vsauce made an educational image collection about them on the multidimensional internet platform MeRod.
I told my crush that she was lookin like a snack, and then she turned into a bag of Skittles. She is fine with it but the temptation of eating her is growing problematic. Anything I can do to make her less edible?
Remind yourself that Skittles are, in fact, inedible in your dimension
Did you transform her through your perception of her as a snack? Do your words shape the very fabric of reality, and speaking it aloud made it to be so because of this? Or did she just do it to make you happy? There's a couple different things you can do, but it depends on how it happened.
You are in a world where skittles are “edible” idk man that sounds a little weird
I’d handle it by believing she is not a snack but a dime. Your crush is now less edible unless you’re brave enough. You’d also be able to put her in your pocket. She raises your own self worth by ten cents.
Marinade her in vinegar.
This might help https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#skittle
Put your dick.
In the bag.

...so you can alter the skittles on a molecular level and render them inedible.

You are welcome.
There’s no problem with eating her if she’s into vore
Tell her she looks like napalm. I'm pretty sure you can't eat napalm
All skittles have an expiration date, you're best to consume her regardless as to wait would be a waste of the skittles.
I don't think skittles are edible above the third dimension
Just tell yourself that you're lookin like a starfish. 

Then consume her.
Tell her that she rocks, and she’s really hot.
Mix with bag of m&ms
Yesterday I awoke as a donut and ate myself completely. All I had to do was vomit myself back into existence and I was fine.
Transmutate the rainbow, then taste it. If it tastes good, continue to eat
Transform it into sour skittles, those things suck in every dimension
Put her in a bowl with M&Ms.
Maybe this is her utmost desire. Don't deprive you or her. Consume!
Sprinkle cyan pepper on your gf. That might work.
Try tasting a rainbow. The bitter spectrum should puy you off eating for a few years.
Just say she's hot. Either her temperature will increase to the point of being inedible, or she will become spicy and thus not as tempting as skittles
Ask her to become chocolate skittles
I usually find (in my dimension, at least) that it is nigh impossible to avoid the impending consumption of anything and everything Skittles and/or something that tastes like the grayscale rainbow. However, when a semi-permeable ally or acquaintance turns into a goldfish, it is much easier to avoid eating them - the fact that they are "the snack that smiles back" outwardly denotes some level of conscious thought, and that calls into question the moral consequences of consuming them.
That might work. Ever since I moved to the √7.8th dimension I've been forgetting that flavours that were sweet in the 10.5th dimension often lead to dismemberment illnesses. I'll keep that in mind, since losing one of my appendages would be fairly inconvenient.
Why would you just guess what dimension he’s in?! Dimensionist!
It was the sheer power of my voice. The impact of the sound rearranged her chemical composition to that of a bag of Skittles. I was tired that day and forgot to control myself.
It's a dream. He'll wake up soon enough
Hey, don't shame.
I put my dick in a bag of doritos; now my uncle is calling me got to go.
But what if they are out of vore? Or in fact, transcedentally phasing through it?
Is that a challenge?
Did this to my gf, she turned into a molten planet and left me for a cooler guy
Sour skittles are delicious, mortal
Well, it really depends on how many you have. I personally have pi^(3*50,000,000,000) diffrent types of appendages, so losing only one wouldn’t present a massive issue
±¢‼7♥π told me that but he was known for being the town truthteller and this was in the Opposite !M§BÜB◙♠ so....
That's actually a good point! Fortunately I was (half) right. I'll make sure to check my privilege in the future. Some poor souls must face edible Skittles after all
Ah, understandable. In that case, perhaps call her something else desirable, but be very careful how your wording- the process of reshaping reality with sound is a delicate one, and it takes into account both your literal meaning and subconscious desires, as seen by what happened to your girlfriend.

So, for example, I would suggest not calling her 'a hot piece of ass-' the literal meaning of the phrase would give you a piece of an ass, and the subconscious desires would make it a visually attractive one, but nevertheless just a piece of one. Of course, if that's what you'd like, and she's alright with it, fire away!
Just saying, sounds like bullshit, how would *skittles* be edible. They don’t even resemble abstract concepts of fear so how could you sustain yourself on them?
I ate Napalm the other day. She was angry at me.
Blasphemy.
Yeah but it would be painful, no?
You both disgust me. OP's crush is still a sentient being with feelings who is deserving of rights and fair treatment! OP ought to transform her into something without those things.
It depends on what dimension your in, I personally know of at least 5 in which the inhabitants are not sugar adapted- merely presenting a package of skittles causes enough of a panic to feast on for days.
Funnily enough, in the √7.8th dimension, pain just tastes like sweetness.
Idk man that just doesn’t sound right. What a weird thing to be edible
It’s a never ending cycle of lost limbs.

I'm not wearing shoes, which is why the ones I own are, in fact, untied.

Of course they are. I took them off.
I'm… not wearing shoes rn?
any update on my laceshoes though?
I dont have shoelaces right now
What's a shoelace? I don't think this universe has those.

Fuck
I’m wearing flip flops
But my shoes are held together by nuclear force..
im wearing crocs :( how do i cross 4th dimension to reach my untied shoelaces
This message arrived at the wrong universe. You want the one adjacent to mine. That version of me is wearing shoes with laces and may need this message.
I'm wearing sandals. But yes. My shoes are on the shoe rack. Untied. So you are right.
My shoes don’t have laces homie
Wait... why do my flip flops suddenly have showlaces?
I hate these kind of spam messages that track you down trying to sell you things. First it's your shoelaces are untied then it's buy new shoes!

Hey it’s a personal choice.
I have one pair of shoes, I am not wearing them, and they are tied. Fight me in the intergalactic plain, motherfucker.
This was sent in error. My shoes were disintegrated with my body a few thousand years ago.
A strange joke to tell an entity with no need for feet, much less shoes or laces.  You humans are odd little things.
Can't I just tie my toes? Shoes were prohibited in my area.
Because I am not using my shoes. I untie them to take them off.
I read this post and yeah, they are untied. I'm also not wearing my shoes though so it doesn't matter?
What happens if they don’t have feet?

Celestial dimension is ok. It doesn't have nearly enough room to move around in.
Why are you worried if you come out alive? Life is overrated. I was once dead for several years for tax purposes. And the forbidden food isn't that great when you don't have a digestive system. Bring me a snowglobe or something instead.
I’m not really that hungry

Can you bring back The Forbidden Snack instead?
Upvotes are such an arbitrary thing beging for them isn't gonna grant mine.
I swear to all the subliminal beings above below and beyond, if this is another bamboozle, I will personally disassemble OP’s divine matrix...
Better keep your promise- haven't had food there in a while. I'm eager to taste some. Be sure to get roasted fde'kei, it's my favorite.
When you go there can you ask for a man named Hoooooooooooooo (that's a normal name in his dimension)? He's an old friend of mine but got missing in the Celestial Dimension about a Zôrgh ago.

Jump into my gaping void pls
Thanks, that's very nice
Well I know a penguin who's a complete asshole.
I highly doubt a gaping void can contain me
And that's because we penguins don't leave things halfway! One of us decides to be an asshole, there's gunna be nothing but a muscle torus left by the end of the week!

A muscle torus, clenching, on the Antarctic shore, like a giant's wedding band. And extruding --- no! --- not a finger, but some other pillar, lifting the ring higher, like a mushroom, as round black-frocked custodians of will caw and hoot. Even as the pillar topples, viscous and chill-atrophied, casting the ring to roll away, yet more is pushed out like some fetid propellant ex nihilo, unceasingly birthed from some shadowy intestinal dimension unimagined by those without the will to see things through.

At McMurdo, we flex.
When I ask my flatmates for rent they turn sideways to avoid me.
Try writing your request on a piece of paper and turn it sideways as well.
If you wouldn't mate with them it would be less awkward. 

Try expanding your horizons by embracing more rounded, holistic relationships.

Of course, it might also help if you persuaded the gibbering stench of the unprocessed VOID to bloodily encromulate your nexspawn's iPseudoPod, just for good measure.
It's alluded to here, but I figure I should make it explicit: If this is a problem, you need to seek out more well-rounded individuals to share space with. I'm all for intertransdimensional harmony, but if you can't get over the fact that they act as though they're from another dimension, you need to do something about it.
Classic mistake manifesting yourself as the landlord, you need to change back and express your being as voidlord.
Bend space into a curve so you can see a cross-section of them. Shift topologies until you find their wallets. Problem solved.

Well you can't respond to them turning sideways, but what ever activated ability they are using you can respond to at instant speed to resolve the issue before it leaves the stack. Search your knowledge, you might have such a utility to use among your various spells or creatures inhabiting your plane.

You could try an omni-directional driver on your planar datastream. The extra dimensional computing should be adequate to track them down as long as they remain in the flat, dorm, timefold, whatever you silly foreigners call it.
Splendid idea! I can also ask them in front of a mirror we are perpendicular to - then when they turn I can still see the bastards.
I would love to take your advice but our relationship is purely plutonic. (Though I've heard cross-dimesnional mating is addictively violent and smells like burning electronics.)
Have you ever tried to mate with a 2D before? We're not just talking flat-chested here, and there's just no way one or another partner is getting up on top....the best you can hope for is rubbing up against each others' sides. I'm over it.
I was going to offer to move into a Klein bottle, but this option is so much less expanspensive.
Damn, that would have really helped with the rent.
Most of them are unfunny/lame, but every once in a while you get a good one.
it tastes like rainbows.
Why do you immediately assume that everyone's 2D and 3D? There are plenty of other hyperspacial orientations out there, and it's closed minded perceptions such as yours that are discriminating against more complex entities, and making young 5D entities the most vulnerable to spontaneous collapse
If you're high on the smell of burning capacitors.

Capacitors: not even once.
5D's don't turn sideways. They do something completely different.
I broke the ice. Great conversation but we all drowned.
Now that you've been down there for quite long, it's time to _come out..._

Sheesh.
Yes
>Should be 01110101

Yes, however that would redirect to the portal 59331[exa-platonic dimensions]. It's not a easily maneuverable space due to constant time paradoxes that keep occurring there. Once I almost caused an unilateral deflation of the universe 3^x2 because I almost saw my grandchild in the same time frame as me being an infant

How about you try 01110011
Well, there's that.
The judge gave me a two-year sentence, but ran out of breath halfway through. Now he has to start over.
Sounds like a you problem. Try to make yourself look prettier so he doesn't have to breathe.
The judge needs an actively pressurized source of air leading into the lungs to ensure the continuity of the sentence. An insufficient air supply is probably due to budget cuts in the court room.

Don't say anything. If the sentence is disrupted for longer than 15 minutes you are **legally** allowed to leave. If the sentence length is greater than the two-years, sue the shit outta them.
I hope you get potty breaks.
Is your defense attorney a rookie? You should plead the 15736th.
Inverse filibusters must be common in your dimension. Refer to The Pocket Universe Handbook, page (-16)x, where x = default electron spin value in your universe. 
Try upsetting the vortex gavel, he might start breaking into song 
Sounds like double jeorpardy. You can't get another sentence, even if it's the same, for the same crime. That's why you should've brought a heckler into the crowd. Stop them early with a distraction and you get out a lot sooner.
Nah, see, the problem there is if you’re pretty he won’t be *able* to breathe, which will exacerbate the problem. 
IANA₩§φA, but if you look a little bit closer into 15736(z)(idixx)(204)(J), you'll see that OP clearly can't plead the 15736th because judges without a conjoined juror are specifically exempt from the declaration of rights and/or liberties. If OP would've pled the 15736th, they'd be in a world of hurt right now (the judge would have to extend the sentence another 2 eons -- ha!). So because the attorney clearly understands dimensional rights better than you, they didn't call it for good reason.
Ah you see, the detail is in the devil. I said pretty, not breathtakingly beautiful. All in moderation.
Actually, I think he has a point. Take look at 1385a~24 F₩Ç §7948Bt(lxi)@ja3&5(2)#y6fe. It repealed that section specifically in cases of felony sentancing.
Aha! I knew ~~someone~~ you would say that. In "Jake vs. Universum" in -5400BC, the defendant was expected to listen through 243 years of sentencing. It was that case that was pivotal in legislating the 15736th which guarantees the defendant - regardless of species or the number of tentacles - to have the right to be put into stasis during the sentencing recital phase, be it verbal or mimed. Any sentencing that takes longer than two weeks is also considered to be a violation of the Sagittarius Conventions.
If the judge is breathtaking, he won't run out of breath because he can keep taking everyone's breath for himself.
Hmm that is true. It depends on your jurisdiction, though. In sector 173389201&&38291937, for example, there's a confederacy which overrules some of the procedure; be careful and good luck!
I’ve heard some judges have recently been delivering their sentences psychically specifically to avoid triggering the “verbal or mimed” clause
Amazing idea
I bottled up my loneliness, and it fermented. Now I have champagne, but no one to drink it with.
Just bottle up some strangers, maybe they'll ferment into friends
Have you tried downloading new friends? It worked for a friend of mine.
As of now, 100% of us have upvoted this, so if you send us your space-time coordinates I think we can have a party.
Imagine having a mouth
I'll drink it with you.
Capitalise on this opportunity, alienate yourself from society, and start a champagne buissness

Unless your loneliness was grown in the Champagne region, it's just sparkling wine
[deleted]
Is it blue flavored?
Should have gone with cabinet sayavong.
The cause is probably dregs of solitude left in the bottom of the bottle. 

Ideally, you would want to rack the loneliness into a secondary fermentor after primary fermentation before bottling. Maybe use a clearing agent. No one enjoys sediments of forlornness.
Read this three times and it got better every single time.
Drink it. You'll gain a bubbly personality and a desire to talk to strangers.
i’ll be in the vortex if you need me 
What you need to do is go out and find a guy with a jar that is where he is not supposed to be. Put bread in the jar and watch the reality warp around you! 
I wish my loneliness was grapes, I’d eat them for sustenance 
Ahh, Champagne de Lone. Almost as nice as a classic glass of Tears of Orphans or [REDACTED] of the Pure
Uss it to make more loneliness, to make more champagne
There is a yeast party within the champagne. Hurry and mingle before they eat all that sweet loneliness and become dormant.
Google wants to know your location
Most of the strangers I've bottled up fermented into enemies.
The ones I downloaded ran away to the northern constellations
You get into the downloadable friends pool only if you haven’t opt out of this at your local Interdimensional Internet Center - the government tries to hide this fact but educate yourself about your interdimensional rights ! Even if it’s just part of your consciousness (but it can be up to 110% of you ) you need to make sure you don’t get selected for programs like this unknowingly.   
I’ll bring some chips and dip!  It’s my own special recipe with avocado, peppers, and condensed joy.

I am trying to sleep but the demons next door are holding a birthday party and the ceaseless screaming of mortals dangling above infernal candles is keeping me up. I don't want to be a killjoy but ten thousand years is hardly enough sleep for a being such as I and I just want them to be more quiet!
I’d suggest inserting tiny black holes into your ears, gets rid of the noise. Also, make sure the black holes are stable, I repeat stable, if they aren’t, then, well let’s just say you’ll see plenty of demons.
[deleted]
Sorry man, but sometimes life is just pure hell. I don’t think you can do much about it.
I would join them. Dangling mortals over infernal candles is a lot of fun, and demons have great parties.  Who needs sleep anyway.
Dark matter is pretty effective for muffling sound. Maybe you could try that? Although you definitely have to be careful when installing it. I lost 3 of my appendages when I tried putting down a dark matter carpet and it ended up jumping realities with no warning
Go easy on them, don’t you remember what it was like to be young unascended celestials?
demon neighbors, amirite?

at least you don’t live next to 17th dimensional immigrants, they smell so bad you can hear brown
AIRPODS.
SOLVED!!!!
Best way to deal with them is using a бθαсχд and engulf them in a pocket dimension. I did this a trillion times, almost noone can come back from that. Apart from Squee. Fuck Squee.
Honestly, whiners like you OP really get on my nerves. 

We've had/will have fucking time machines for ages now (or then), why the fuck aren't you just going back and sleeping until now?
Honestly, it's just rude that they aren't eating all of the sound they make! It's common courtesy for these things!
lol werk
Banish them to the third to live out their lives as... mortal humans.
Have you tried the sound of monotonous flutes and maddening drums? Always puts me right into dreamland.
Send them a strawberry cake that has holy water.
I'd suggest using a sonic quantum field generator to keep your house noise free
Cant believe no one suggested Soundless Horrors. Just avoid the toothless ones. No teeth and their sentient. Used them ONCE and woke up without my non and corporeal forms. Thought they were real funny. 

But yeah, Soundless horrors feed off any type of sound. They reproduce once the sound is gone so also have a Death Cat on scene. They'll eat any extra Horrors that pop up but always leave one left over. This way you can always sleep as long as you like AND can let the Demons have their fun.

You could also just try bribing the demons. Idk how u feel about providing mortals but bribing maybe easier. Up to you.
tell the landlord ?
i know bob really does like oysters!
No, that'll just ensure that any sound within the event horizon will be drawn into OP's ears
Another option would be to insert a tiny black hole into the human's mouths. That way all the sound will get sucked up and the demons will still have there fun. Everyone wins
Maybe a vone chqhek?
I mean, the devil is in the details. Maybe he can try to be more vague?
Ah, I remember those days, carefree, sleepless, eternal and yet newborn, I suppose I did the same things back then but they have no excuse to repeat my mistakes, the lack of sleep back then has left me with several underdeveloped limbs

Yeah. They honestly work surprisingly well considering they are merely 3-dimensional.
Well *maybe* some of us have non-linear time that is/was only accessible to time machines twice in a standard Abyssal year Zalthos!
He said he didn't want to be a killjoy...
Yeah, but like its so expensive, the only place you can get them is the centre of infinity and you know how high prices there get!
I want to silence them not banish them, if I wanted to do that I would just shove a couple antacids into the screaming maw of the Abyss
I try but they just scream at me in infernal tongues. I think I paid my rent late, can't tell with this whole spiral-time shenanigans
That only happens within the AFZ-25 universe group, and demons don’t exist in that group, so black holes will work in OP’s universe
Isn’t the whole point of torturing them to hear the human screaming?
Bhhhhhhhhuygbbbbgggggyyyyyyy. .
Maybe he should get to know them, I mean the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.

Gotcha, thanks for the tip
I’ve just got back from my fifth LGBTQ awareness parade and now I am aware of the exact locations of all gays in a 2 mile radius. How do I turn this ability off?
Turn off Grindr?
There should be a slider in the settings? It might be easier to just find a new vessel, tbh
Send me the coordinates of that guy across the street with the big dick, I'll need him for a moment.
You should be getting awareness of every lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer as well. Keep attending awareness parades and once you gain awareness of all 5 you should be able to shut it off at will.
Attend a conservative Church/Mosque for 4~5 weeks. Be careful though, attending too long may have the inverse effect, increasing the gaydar radius.
Just be aware of the exact momenta of all gays in a 2 mile radius instead.
The Gaydar can be disabled by engaging in exceptionally heteronormative activity. One swift way to stop the Gaydar is to aquire a propane grill (borrowing one will suffice), grill some "hot dogs" for about fifteen minutes while repeating aloud "golly, I sure do love my wife" and the Gaydar will shut down. Now I must warn you not to exceed half an hour of this activity, as the effects of continuing this ritual are unpredictable and may have undesirable results.
You will have to remove the memory of attending the parade and replace it with a deep and persistent dread of purple lizards. It is the only way.
There is a button right above the prostate, unfortunately it may be hard to reach so you might need a friend to help
Go to the Settings menu in your HUD and select “Show Allies”, uncheck
Don’t worry, that effect wears off in a day or two. If you want it again, just go to another parade.
Why would you?
Use it to your advantage ;)))
Send the ability to me through metaphysical link dude, i need that ability
Conversion therapy
You have to have sex with all of them by assuming your gender and morphing into a form they find pleasing. Once this is accomplished, their status on the gaydar will go from green to pink.

Once you have copulated with all of them, the gaydar unit will shut off.
youbcant
Or Growlr lol
yeah, you should always have few vessels in your spirit base
A moment? U must be one of the quick ones
Hahahaha I get it
I have some bad news, the grill method alone no longer works.

My ribs are fucking amazing though.
Remember to talk about her heavy breasts and her thigh gap.
Do I even want to know what that is? Because it sounds furry ngl
Time is an illusion, nutting doubly so.
This one sciences ^
i think the more you use it the less effective it is, maybe try the above commenters tip of adding talk about your wife's huge breasts and massive thigh gap to the ritual?
There's nothing more intoxicating than the clear absence of a penis.
It's not, it's a Grindr ripoff for the bear/masc community
My boyfriend might get very confused.
Yeah Howlr is the furry one
I don't want that to be real so I won't Google it
Thanks for the info, I had no idea this was a thing but I'm glad it is

That is the Reddit way, but quite frequently in here we don't understand one another.

Some speak in mathematical formulas, some speak in binary (or trinary), some draw unspeakable glyphs under moonlight in the blood of virgins, some spew colored liquids from several gibbering orifices, and there's one individual I won't name who communicates with scents, usually nasty ones.  We had a universal translator, but someone from another metaverse tried to use it and it exploded in their pseudopod.  

Just roll with the lack of understanding.  Let it embrace you and whisper its sweet, dark, nothings in your ear as you're lulled into blackest, frozen oblivion.  Don't resist, and everything will become clear, as clear as starlight on fields that lay dying in the first killing frost of autumn.

LPT: if you want to win an argument, get everyone on the opposing person's side. Once they pass the weight limit, their side should sink.
But balance it out using communism.

I heard that the weight limit in sentient souls is the population of the known universe, so jump on the other side really quick once you get everyone else on. Make sure to jump off before you sink into the void

I'm a university physics teacher, and I accidentally asked a question involving pounds instead of Kilograms on a test, and now there's mass confusion. What do I do?
[deleted]
Oh so THAT's why my recipes are turning out weird!
I think we can help each other. I’m a bank teller in the UK and accidentally performed some transactions involving pounds instead of US Dollars. Now my customers are demanding change. Let’s take advantage of the mass confusion and lack of change and respawn somewhere where the people are a bit more patient.
A simple conversion should do the trick. Divide by 2.2 and badabing. No more mass confusion.
Easy: one pound is equal to 1.19 Euro. The mass of 1 Euro in 7.5 g. So one pound is 1.19*7.5 = 8.925g.
Reset to initial conditions, fix variable and run test again. ^^edit: ^^probably ^^wont ^^work ^^though
Explain that pounds measure force and not mass. That retroactively should fix it
Add more gravity to the situation to put more weight on it. That way, it would depend on the person's location, so there would only be a relatively small problem.
After studying physics and math at CMU, I self-studied the foundations of quantum mechanics for about 10 years (though my knowledge of the standard model and quantum field theory, in general, is very limited.  I got completely stuck on understanding Gaussian/normal Integrals).

Mass confusion of units is pretty much the norm, as I (poorly) understand.  To reconcile this particular mistake, you definitely have to understand the Higgs boson (which might not actually be a particle or a wave?) and the function it has in mechanistically determining mass.  Once you understand the mystery of that exotic God damn "Particle", you'll never again be confused about which mass units to use in any description in general.  (And you definitely won't confuse mass with weight as you did)

As for literally correctly applying the laws, and never incorrectly using or expressing the wrong mass or weight unit, this is obviously an issue with more gravity.  Relatively far more difficult and important.  Wrong speech and action always leave chaos in their wake (the disturbance they causes and imply around them).  However, if you're determined/motivated to do so, then by your own nature, you will find the ability to perpetually choose to attempt this, and you will lead your own self to find proper the judgement of mass and tell/do it wholly damned impeccably.

Is that a Q.E.D.?  Either way, I think you'd have made that crazy fine bastard Feynman proud just by working on thus.  It's definitely about time.  However, watch out.  I doubt either of us would have made Schwartzschild very proud, and his, and the friends of Wigner, will likely come asking a lot of questions and denying any answers, no matter how correct they are.
Stare into the setting pun.

Figure it out yourself Newton, you're the professor.
Ironic, I'm a university physics professor so I think I can help in this situation. So here's the steps

1.) So 1 mile is equal to 3 minutes 43 seconds 13 milliseconds, and 1 second is equal to roughly 9.192631770 billion Hz at the ground state hyperfine transition frequency of a Caesium-133 atom

2. If you take 3.718833 (fraction of minutes in 1 mile) times the frequency of the unperturbed Caesium atom times 1/60 you get 569764424. 

3. Divide that by ((phi)e^13(phi/pi) and add (16(e^2)(phi/pi)+pi) to get ......

Voilà! 1609, the starving time winter in Jamestown, as well as the number of kilometers in 1000 miles. Hope this helps!
Congratulations, you win the price for the most unexpected, but still technically true statement!
Turn it off and on again
Except that would cause a mass-force confusion, something even worse.
Did you gather the lizards though
I do hope that as a physics teacher, this is the method you use to help your students remember km to mi conversion. Truly, Very well done, and mark my words, I will use this one day. And that's a threat, not a promise.
If my girl friend is any indication, I'm terrible at turning anything on. Jk, I don't have a gf. So alone
Oh shit are they coming for us?
I'm working on it; so far I've only been able to find 433...where are they hiding?
They’re always coming for us.
They are if the damned Mr. Professor forgot to gather them!
The mole ate them
Wait, if they're coming for us, why do we need to gather them?

Hi there - this is your sleep paralysis demon. Just a friendly reminder that we make less than minimum wage, and tips are greatly appreciated! See you in your dreams!
You guys are great! I’m actually afraid to go to bed now, so I’ll make sure I give ya’ll a tip next time I wet myself
So do I leave the tip on the bedside table, or...? I mean, I can't move, right?
I'm not trapped in my dreams with you. You're trapped in my dreams with me.
I did not order and do not wish to receive your service, so I'll be damned if I'm going to tip for it.  That said, here's a thought: unionize!  (Not like *that*, you filthy chemistry perv!)  You poor bastards are some of the hardest workers in the biz, you deserve a 5 morning workweek as much as everybody else.

"See you in your dreams"? Laughs loudly and bitterly!

Always when I dream I look for you. Everywhere I search for you. In every single bubblegum forest and glass grassland. All the horses with human faces I ask where you are. I climb all the toffee mountains and inquire all the fire-belching faces in the clouds: where are you. I endure nudity and demand the class tell me your location. But no. You are never to be found, in my dreams.

Then I wake up, and I can't even move. It is dark and I can hardly breathe. Failure is crushing down on me. And then there you are.

I mean, my dear sleep paralysis demon, there are nicer places to meet than my bedroom. Maybe we could meet somewhere else the next time.
I’m quite new to this - when I can’t move, how exactly do I tip you? Is it like with my crippling sense of self-worthlessness demons, where I have to mention it in great detail to friends and therapists the next morning, and that generates your misery rating on Jinnadvisor?
But I don’t pay you at all
I got tips last night sucker
Really? You ask for tips when you haven't come in several months?? Get to work already
Thank you for your service!
Keep your foot off my blasted samophlange!
YEAH, I DON'T TIP, SO WHAT?! Glad you simply stopped visiting me instead of, say... peeing in my shoes or spitting on me...
Do you prefer cash or SOUL payments?
How come I never see you guys in Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha? The demons are paid well here so it's not customary to tip unless you really enjoy (so to speak) the service

Hi I'm a dream demon for Paradash, and just want to remind you that if your sleep paralysis is being serviced through Paradash to please tip in cash and not through the app, they take most of it unless you tip really really well.
Just convey intent, with a clear dollar amount, and it will be taken with much gratitude
Parry this you fucking casual.

-lucid dreamers probably
Oh no
**sigh**

You need to remember the old saying, "If their income relies on tips, they're not crushing the life out of you with existential dread because they *like* you."  Way too many mortals think hitting on sleep paralysis demons in the workplace is acceptable.
No, no, those bastards are thirsty for ratings. We’re just trying to make an honest living.

Like I told the other guy, just convey intent, with a clear dollar amount, and it will be taken with much gratitude

We prohibit our workers from taking essence payments. Pure energy, especially of that caliber (touched by god) can really mess one of us up. We take cash and card both

Hi, I’ll attempt to reconnect you with your spd.
What was his/her given name? Also, if you could describe their tendencies, that would help us further in identifying them.

Go get ‘em, boy!
Ah, come off of it, it's not like they *have to* have a deer skull for a head! These little demons know exactly what they're doing and besides I am very charming, have you considered that possibility, I've seduced a coroner while we both were at work, and once I got a ride at the DMV. I've multiple written testimonials from different things, some with skull heads the size of whale skulls, that I'm very charming and they're not lying. When I move I have to warn the neighbors, else they'd come over to borrow sugar or baby blood and we'd end up in a pentagram just doing IT and each other. I'm not saying I'm a sex god but the ASL symbol for me is "huge prick", if you know what I mean.

Come to think of it, the way you sigh is as cold as the breath of a grave, but compared to the chill blue entropic fire of your dying-star eyes that's still pretty... hot.

Do you know any old sayings that are more... *erratic?*

I've always identified as male, but lately I've realized that I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. How do I come out to my parents?
Destroy their planet. They will come to understand in time.
Trust me, they knew before you did.  Just start killing shit.  It's all gravy, baby. 
You are who you are, you just have to accept yourself and everything will be okay. 
Your parents should love you for who you are. They aren't losing a son, they're gaining a DeathSpawn.

There are support groups for them, like PFDDW. Maybe you can even get them to join a pride parade. I mean, they won't survive, so prepare for that.
Don't worry, someday, at the end of their mortal existence, they'll see you as you really are.
[deleted]
You just made me sblargh all over my nitherrath. L0L!
Tell them you are Vegan first. When you later tell them you were kidding and are Death they will be relieved. 
Just be glad you have a nuclear family.
Have you tried killing them?  I'll admit it's a bit more subtle than destroying their world, but sometimes you have to take these things slowly.
Just let them understand that even though you aren't really a boy, and are actually the apocalypse itself unleashed to cleanse the earth of putrefied humanity, you're still their kid, and love them. Just take it slow x
While I realize that this may be a awkward and uncomfortable topic to broach with one's loved ones, it's important to remain calm and collected, be comforting, and call forth the ether of Hell to rain fire, sulfur and brimstone upon the sodomites and heathens of the mortal realm. As long as you're true to yourself, your parents will understand, or will suffer everlasting nuclear winter.
You don't want them to freak out. Tell them it's just a phase.
With a bang.
Just kill every male in existence, then they'll have to know that you're not a male when you're still left standing. When your mom and eternal dad asks, you can take it from there.
Become a duck, duck > death.
"Hey, you know how we're a *nuclear* family...?"
Roses are red

I will sacrifice animals to you
it really looks like you should sit them down, talk to the neighbour, ask them where to find the slip of paper containing the guys name who has "the best WiFi on the block", find his daughter and she will tell you.
Mort?
Time heals all, eternity should be enough.
You can always just oppenheimer out of telling them anything. They will figure it out eventually. 
I'd suggest taking them on a holiday to somewhere tropical, maybe Bikini Atoll, and demonstrating your new identity then.
Rosebud.
Just be straight with them. Lots of supreme deities in your position come out with spectacular nuclear explosions, but there's no need to be flamboyant.
Remember!  They are your parents.  They have known the whole time.  Don't worry so much.
It gets better, hugs

Great, another one of them there nukes. We don't need things like you!
Accept your role, and use it to your family's benefit. Destroy any and all things which annoy them in the slightest, including yourself. You will return, so destroy your worries as well.
We've all thought that, one way or another. 
Cum ON to your parents.
Or just kill them directly.

Or better yet, do both, and you am become Superbatman.

Where's my cup...
Heh, time. I remember that. One of the most boring next weeks I've ever had. 
I accepted Jesus as my savior, but he keeps using 'Save As...' and now there are more than 87 of me.
I feel pretty good about choosing Jesus as my printer. Fair quality at a descent price.
'go forth and multiply'
convert to scientology. better file extensions that allow metadata so each copy is unique. also provides timestamp so you know which one is the one drinking your apple juice.
If my calculations are correct, when you get up to 88 copies, you're gonna see some serious shit.
I think it's a bug, Jesus always sends a backup to the cloud.  But currently the connection is broken.  
Western religions have always lacked proper version control systems.
You are going to have to diff all those versions into a single unit. Good luck unless you have a multithreaded universe to run that on. 
Commit yourself to a Git repository.  Then, at least, you'll have some idea as to which version you are.
Consult your local bible support
Which one are you?
I take it you were born in 1913 - it's a good thing that every other dimension had a severe Y2K computer crash, otherwise we'd be inundated with youdundacies.
I ran into this exact problem myself here's what you do.

Put the 87 copies of yourself in individual realities or I like to call "folders" then compress them into one massive folder, excuse me reality 
Accept JR Bob Dobbs as your savior next time and you wont have this problem
[deleted]
Perhaps the full saying is "Jesus saves... In case he gets hungry later."
>Fair quality at a descent price.

If you're going to Jesus for your printing, wouldn't it be more of an ascent price?

I heard it takes him three days to restore from a save point.

I thought he was a shepherd...
Also takes only 6 days for intial booting. Not bad for a super-sentience if you ask me.
No, you linear minded fool! He was a gardener. I met him once.
He wasn't a very good gardener. I hired him to water my roses, but he just stood on the hose and brought my weeds back to life.
I took the hose from him afterwards and tried watering the plants but it just kept spraying wine everywhere.
He has yet to pay me back for that fig tree he cursed for bearing no fruit.
Now I have become omnipresent I totally get why God wanted us to stop masturbating.
Omnipresent? That's not just seeing all; it is being in all things.

Every thrusting hip.

Every englobulation of a limb.

Every formed triangle.

Every ichor-crying pseudopod.

Every snorting, slavering *mastodon dentata*.

Every tissue.

Every brain ganglia.

You're not an observer. You're a participant, forced to act out every fevered fantasy thundering in your senses from your indiscriminate participation in nerves and brain cells, forced to make every lone practitioner not alone --- but they'll never know it!

You should try and speak, move their lips as the solitary pleasure overtakes them, and make their mouths scream out: "You are not alone! I am always watching you! Don't do that thing with your wrist at the end it is rubbish!"

You're omnipotent god dammit. Just make yourself into that!
HhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggGGGGGGGG
Hey, no kink shaming you omnipresent coconut headass
You also gotta see all the freaky self mutilation porn.
Not even hot chicks? :p
You’ll be watching me jack off in hell, motherfucker!
/r/madlads
I'm doing it rn
Me too
honestly the fact that god is watching encourages it.
Lemme put it to you this way:

Divide the population by male/female and hot/not. 

Assuming that OP is male and heterosexual, then he will likely only enjoy watching women jill-off.

If the hot/not catagories are determined by OP's sexual preferences, then we can assume that he will only enjoy watching people belonging to the "hot" category.

Therefore, the population will represented similarly to this:

###M F
###1 2 H
###3 4 N

Based upon the previous assumptions, OP will not enjoy watching groups 1 or 3(contains only men), nor group 4(not in his preferences). He will only enjoy watching group 2, as it consists of subjectively hot women.

As a result, OP will only enjoy 1/4th of what he sees, or 25%. The other 3/4th(75%) is not enjoyable.
Cosmic voyeurism is the best fetish
He just needs to learn to focus his attention, to filter information.
He's omniscient, not omnipotent. You can't subtract from infinity, cap'n.

Edit: or, rather, omnipresent. The point stands.
> You can't subtract from infinity, cap'n.

Not as such, perhaps. But it's not like you can't count through infinite integers just because there is an infinite number of rationals between each integer (never mind the irrationals). You can have larger or smaller infinite sets.
I pressed the CTRL key on my standing desk, and now I'm stuck crouching. I cant reach my keyboard.
just wait till you die and respawn, the default  mode is staning up.

And set crouch to hold instead of toggle, then you  cant make  the mistake again.
You can increase your jump height by firing a rocket launcher at the floor while in mid air.
UPDATE:  
So many helpful people here. I took folk's advice and fell off of the 2nd floor balcony. Im no longer stuck in crouching, but now this red liquid is coming from my mouth. I assume its from the strawberry tart I ate yesterday...it might have been bad. However it doesnt taste like a strawberry tart, so Im thinking that this is what strawberries mixed with stomach acid tastes like. My abdomen hurts as well. I havent been in combat lately, so Im hoping my health regens soon....Im also kind of dizzy....
who tf uses toggle crouching?
>bind mouse1 "togglecrouch"

just hit your desk to knock the mouse off
Ah, a familiar problem. My reliable method to escape this is to roll into the corner where my desk touches the wall. The impact causes minor harm, but you can then damage boost into the space between the wall and the desk. Once there, clipping errors will force you to be shoved upwards and back onto your desk, where you can safely and easily press CTRL again to stand back up.
How did you type this
What did you say? Sorry, I can't hear you!
I actually hate these posts. If you were stuck crouching you wouldn't have been able to post this unless you were lying. I cant believe how far people will go for some karma
r/outside ?
And this is why I hate sticky keys.
My favorite part is not realizing what subreddit these posts are in until wayyy later
Press space and jump higher
My thoughts and prayers are with you.
Find a regular desk and assume their life.
Unplug the keyboard under the desk
What is this shit, everyone knows that you crouch with C key.
AGH! Im such an idiot...of course, of course.....so Ill just go to the 2nd floor and fall off the balcony. Ill let you know how it goes.
Im so glad I came here. Im getting lots of good advice!
[deleted]
Maybe try looking under the doormat for a health kit, that should help!
Just eat an apple or a full roast turkey that you can find under random trash cans in the street, you'll be ok.
I didnt mean to. Luckily it's fixed from my fall off of the balcony. Although I suspect this red stuff is from that Strawberry tart I ate yesterday, it doesnt taste like strawberries. Strawberries and stomach acid maybe?
Hmmmm, also an excellent idea. I gotta remember that
I had my phone. Silly.
Luckily, the crouch has been cancelled, after another kind Redditor reminded me that jumping off of a balcony will cancel the crouch. Now my tummy hurts and this red stuff is pouring out of me. Dont eat strawberry tarts before falling off of a balcony.
I had my phone in my pocket.
My C key was stuck because my son spilled dog syrup on it.
How did it go?
Dude...sneaking stops you from falling off of heights...
Ohhhhhh, like on Metal Gear.
See, a buddy of mine told me on Skyrim when he was about to die, he ate 35 full wheels of cheese. Unfortunately, my backpack is at home.
Download a full mobile keyboard and press the ctrl key. Should be good to go!
But then you can just go to the save menu and load up the last save point. Doesn't the game autosave at new level?
Well, Im pretty bruised up, but apparently jumping negates crouching. Now I've got the red stuff coming out of my mouth, and my tummy hurts. I did eat a strawberry tart yesterday, it must have been bad.
Oh, we forgot to tell them to turn one life mode off...
Not unless you jump
Great idea! I think I can get that at the same place I download RAM.
Yeah, but if I load back, then I gotta start my whole work day over. Who the hell wants to do that?
Ahh yes bad strawberry tarts to fix this keep jump and respawn
Hopefully this is one of those times were you can regen health though honestly it’s more enjoyable to have permanent health loss. Really makes it a whole lot more exhilarating when a bullet wissez by you. Also where’s you team? Shouldn’t they have gotten the bomb down on B already?

*cough* thanks for the advice.
My team was dealing with a bunch of adds that came in through the front door.
In 2319, Pranks will be Like, "Ok, Jimmy is sleeping, We are going to modify his gene X-6788 to grow Taste buds in his asshole".
Sal time traveled to year 2319 to see how they prank people in the future but it backfires on him, making him tonight's biggest loser.
You silly fool. By then VR will be so good you'll put it on your friend and make him believe he is in a different universe entirely.
Actually your asshole already has tastebuds...

Lemmie see if I can find the article.

Edit: Well apparently even your testicles have tastebuds...also the anus.

Dad was right. Mom’s meatloaf really does taste like shit
When I hear 2319 I just think of "white sock"
Is this a subtle nod to Monsters Inc. or am I just going too deep into this?
My friend did this once that was embarrassing to watch.
Sorry but let me just slightly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L1QIJ9PQ2M
I bet the pranks will be hacking your friend's vape and changing the flavor from strawberry to dick
Modifying someone else's genes without consent while sleeping?

Sounds pretty fucking illegal to me
Dinner so nice you gotta taste it twice
I hope that by 2319 the general public knows the difference between a good prank and being a jerk.
By 2319 we will either all be dead or have uploaded our consciousness into quantum computers
Nah we'll probably just keep drawing dicks on each other's foreheads cause dicks will always be funny
Ha, ha... Very funny, guys. Yeah, tastes like shit, y'got me. You still can't beat the time you did it to Mikey and he said it tasted like Joey's dad.
Great job copying an already famous meme dude!
Or "Ok Jimmy is sleeping. We are going to hide his rat leg and tell him he has no more food for the next 3 days".
🏅 take this Hobo Gold
Cyberpunk'd 2319
Isn't 2319 the code they use in monsters inc.  To classify a child outbreak?
I think we've been overestimating how much our technology will advance.  


It'll be more like "hey, this iphone 59 has an x-ray on the camera, cool!"
Yum.
Plot twist, Jimmy likes to eat shit.
In The Orville (which I'd heartily recommend), Gordon [lost his](https://youtu.be/01HMXioj_ZU?t=80) leg in a prank. So as technology improves where the long term impact is negligible, I suppose anything is possible.
Why do we still have assholes in 2319? What a failure for science.
And then Jimmy convinces you that shit tastes like bacon and gets you to eat a turd.
"Wait, the gene scanner says he already has taste buds there.  WHAT THE FRYZYK, Jimmy‽‽‽‽‽"
In 2319 I expect more jokes involving Monsters Inc. and socks.
Bold of you to assume we won’t have killed ourselves off by then.
Quick! Put on the vr contacts.
In 2319, seeing how the joke ideals are evolving, we will be able to shut up in 5 different accents, and seeing jpg artifact as a meme.
Disgusting but brilliant
Stop smoking the crack!
r/brandnewsentence
So you're saying in 2319, we will be able to taste what we shit? Awesome.
One can only hope

I would hate to be jimmy.
"all I taste is shit" lolol
I’m disappointed that in the year 2319 we still have names as boring as Jimmy when we could have JaęΔmÿω✌︎๑
Ughhhhh cringe
Was this not a comic before?
We will all be dead
In the year two thousand!

*y'all can't see it but I'm holding a flashlight under my chin while typing out this comment*
What the fuck do you take before you go to a shower dude
Nobody going to mention 23 19? Monster's Inc. Anyone?
Monsters Inc. WE HAVE A 2319
I like how the name Jimmy would still exist in 2319
It's just a prank bro.
Bold of you to assume that humanity will survive till then
Y'all copied this from a meme from like.. a year or two ago. Be more original please and thanks.
Assuming gene splicing will be legal to the public?
Pfff, by 2030 eating ass will be common place in every household anyway.
Little did they know, Jimmy already had taste buds in his asshole...
That's when you discover that Jimmy has a coprophilia fetish and now he just walks around with a permanent erection.
I'm glad I'll be long dead by then. Screw asshole buds.
Why would that be a prank
That would be the funniest prank ever done
You have a weird mind, OP.
Will humanity even be around by then? For all we know we might fuck ourselves over and we end up at square 1 again. Or we kill ourselves off.
I hope I die before that
We’ve got a 2319
We got a 23-19!!
It’d be funnier if they grew assholes on his taste buds
Whatever species develops greater intelligence is going to have a blast, because we humans will be long dead by then
Why do they think he'll discover he has taste buds in his asshole?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Great, now I'm sad I'm not gonna be alive in 2319.
I dont really think cuz they might not even know how to.. or there might be a separate machine for that too!
Saw a few things similar to that, including animation where a couple guys who finds a genie has the one wish his friend who is standing there has tastebuds in their asshole. Also wasn't the first time I saw this post, either.
In 2319 it's gonna be so hot you'll be glad you're long dead.
Bold of you to assume the human race will survive to that time.
\*wakes up\* ughh what is that?!
I think your expectations are a bit high
That is a very old meme my friend
This is a true shower thought
We already have taste buds in our balls...sort of.

I had a text message exchange years ago similar to this. Made my day, thank you.
Jimmy becomes the judge of MasterChef, and then goes on saying  " it TASTES LIKE SHIT " to every dish 🤪
This isnt a showerthought. This was a viral tweet from like 4 years ago
I hope someone modifies my genes so I can become a little kid, and sneak up behind innocent children then stick my raging kid-boner inside of them, and furiously fuck them.
2319 ... A sock
\[Year, 2319\]

Random dude: \*hitting blunt\* Yo man, did you know people back in 2019 thought we would achieve cool stuff like gene modification by now.

Random dude's friend: Yeah man they probably were bunch of losers!!
Now *these* are the kind of thoughts I have in the shower
What if you still liked your own brand 😳

Would farts be appetizers?
I see this as an absolute win
Sign me up
Yeah right. It's 2019 and we have a fucking idiot in the whitehouse and one third of this country thinks he deserves to be there permanently. Think about that for a second, one third of this country. Not including the fucking idiots in other countries.
!remindme 300 years
2319! 2319! Hes got a human sock on his back, sound the alarm!
This reminded me of a Dave Chapelle’s set: yeah, Frank fell asleep so we like stuck a carrot up his ass (on how white people always do borderline gay shit pranks when they’re high)
And never forget about gene X-80085
Holy shit this is the worst sub I've ever seen. Unsubscribed.
In 2319 Jimmy will be sleeping and we'll put his consciousness back into his squishy meat body
In 2319 it will be the equivalent of fart jokes among morons because any educated individual will know that this is not how genes work.
Ha. I see you think we'll be that much more advanced in the year 2319. This is similar to Back To The Future thinking we would have hovering cars and skateboards by now
Bold of you to assume that humans won't die out by then.
 In his other asshole 😏
Like his BrainPal wouldn't alert him to the danger.
RemindMe! 300 years

I love king khan and the bbq show
It’s 2319, people’ll eat ass
We have taste buds in our asshole tho.


But we don't taste it actively, it's more like so our body knows what's wrong with our shit.
But what about the socks on monster backs?
I chuckled at this, funny as fuck
Bold of you to assume people will be named in current form
This is a meme, an old meme
no, no it wont asshole
I don't think we'll survive till 2319
Ah man that really sucks that by that year we will all be dead from global warming
Bold of you to assume we'll survive after 2050
Bold of you to assume humanity makes it to 2319
Bold of you to assume the human race won't be extinct in 2319
In 2319 world wouldn't exist because of global warming.
Fools, you honestly think there will be 2319?
_Laughs in Global Warming_
I remember seeing this on iFunny a really long time ago. Good memories of when I was a heathen and used iFunny.

Yeah but not actually because then we would already know that

Yeah, sorry; I'm not putting money on that, b.

To keep in line with the futuristic scenario, we'll have to start CRISPRing *actual dicks* on people's foreheads...
We’ll be growing them on people’s heads by then
What a dick move, you dick, lol still funny
Wasn't it like an office parody as well? Dwight and Jim?
I thought people wont get the Easter egg
But the Samsung entire galaxy came out 3 years prior and had that feature already.
Great, cause what I need is *more* vectors from which to develop cancer...

I think your timeline is *very* optimistic. Stem cell research was halted for so long due to irrational stupidity and currently there's literally people out there that are 'super concerned' and protesting  about people changing their own bodies and/or their sex.


If we have this much issues getting people to accept that others are allowed to modify *their own* bodies... imagine how long it would take for that type of tech you mentioned to be publicly available enough for kids to play pranks with it.
Ah, then you're just in the wrong subs probably maybe.

Holy shit, he's taking Roy off the grid! Hey, this guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy!
Years ago I saw this comment from a guy who had something like this happen him. I'm not sure how true it is but it seemed to be real. The guy had a wife he loved and kids. One evening he was sitting on the couch and he was fixated on the lamp on the side table. It didn't look right, after awhile he realised it was unnatural. Like it's shadows were unrealistic and it looked like a glitch. He said that he became worried and agitated and it triggered him  to wake up. He a young man again after getting knocked out by some guy in a joke go wrong and his entire life was some sort of coma dream. He seemed really genuinely upset that the woman he'd married had never existed.

This sounds stupid when I write it but I was upset when I read it!
We’re all out of off white Persian
That's not just an episode, it's real
Pzzt, If you gonna prank someone you dont send then to the Gaurd, you send them to be in a Genestealer Cult.

I read the same comment. It wasn't years ago, maybe late last year. You're not crazy and it affected on some level aswell. It was written well and engaging. Now I'm going to be thinking about this until I find it lol.

When you lose your sense of taste, do your taste buds fall out?

An anus actually has tastebuds, however they are used in a different manner.
Truly you are the next Einstein
There are tastebuds but they rent linked. It's not that hard. They're just not *functional* tatsebuds.
Ever eat really spicy food?
Do blind people have eyes? Do deaf people have ears? Do stupid people have brains?
Have you ever had a CT scan with iodine contrast? It's like a burning fishy sort of taste sensation that you can absolutely detect in your asshole and mouth and to a lesser extent everywhere else. It's like the Extra Hot Flaming Cheetos version of getting your plasma returned when running a double-red blood donation.
Do you? Yes, do you do it consciously the exact same way that you do with your tongue? No.  So yes actually there are taste buds there. Sorry that you seem to be incapable of accepting human anatomy.

Mannnn, I was hoping I'd be the next Einstein..... Dreams crushed.
If you don’t taste with them, they’re not actually taste buds. It’s idiotic to try to claim they are on a technicality.
If you don’t taste with them, they’re not actually tastebuds in any meaningful way. Stupid technicalities to try them to claim they are  are worthless.

I saw the link, you were right. It must have been a rabbit hole I went down recently. Very good story though.
In my case it would explain all of these memes i've seen, I was one weird fucking kid
You mean...Phoenix Person? Yes, he'll be there.
Fuck me, wish I checked his name before.
Blind people don't have eyes. Deaf people don't have ears. Paralyzed people don't have bodies. This makes sense.
If you dont hear with them theyre not actually ears. If you dont walk with them theyre not actually feet
Bruh if you get paralyzed from waist down but your legs are still attached, do you say my legs aren't legs anymore
if my car runs out of gas it isnt functional as car anymore but you would still say its a car. stop beeing so oblivious.
If sword is dull and doesn't cut anything it's still a sword, but you wouldn't understand since your head is so far up your ass your body probably looped as much as the original jojo universe when pucci got made in heaven
They're the same proteins that are present in our tongues that we used to taste. This is not a technicality. Doesn't matter if they're functional or not, they're the same compounds.
And blind people don't have eyes and deaf people don't have ears.

Bad news, neither Tony nor Winterfell Starks have a good survival rate.

So’s Tony.
I accidentally told my son he could be everything when he grew up instead of anything. Now he's travelling across the universe consuming all matter.
I think the agreement should become void once he consumes the agreement and all involved parties. I'm not a lawyer, though.
You'll have to perform a total universal reformat. Your son will be lost in the process but if you're a parent worth your salt, you'd have an early backup. 
It can be difficult to accept seeing your little boy change as he grows up, but what's important is that he's found something he really *fits*. I'd say accept his destiny as the impending heat-death of the universe. Who knows, maybe you'll bond over it and come to form new, happy memories <3
It's fine. Since he's also a weekend you have custody full time now. Which is great since he's also time!
Have you tried calling Silver Surfer? Or any Celestials?
Tell him he’s absolutely nothing to you, should fix it...
Have you tried turning him off and on again?
This sounds like a great opportunity to establish a close bond with your sun, so brighten up!

Living next to a black hole is both a blessing and a curse. Sure, it's pretty to look at, but the lack of entitial regulation draws in some shady characters. I can't even cross the asteroid belt without some snake oil salesman hawking radiation at me.
SORRY, LORD AZATHOTH THE NUCLEAR CHAOS NEEDS IT TO SLEEP! YOU LIKE TO EXIST, RIGHT?
It's gone now; you can hear yourself think now.

You think, I haven't touched that wall, ever, have I? It looks all solid but it could be just paper. Maybe, ha ha, there's a hidden room there.

Full of spiders.

No, but like a TV crew. Filming, all the time. Cutting my 24h life into a 3min daily montage of epic. Or, no, porn. The pervert sort, zooming into my ankles and how my lateral malleoluses chafe against the skin, such tee-asy fibulas. I could be a sex god to the forum people.

No no, you think, if there's a secret room in my house it's long empty, dusty, cobwebby ---

Full of spiders.

--- who lived here before I did? Did they have a panic room? Who woke up there, all panic and gag and tied arms? "Montresor, for the love of God---"

You think, that turned dark. You were lost in a reverie, while the world moved on. You think, and try to not think that you think, because bending back on itself like that hurts, and you fear if maybe you could see what you are doing, you couldn't do it anymore. The magic trick falls apart, and you remain there, sitting, the loop sprung, breathing, blinking, shivering, and truly not self-conscious for once. All of you, except that self-referential loop in the brain; a still meat suit with metaphorical gunsmoke drifting through the throne room of the homunculus. A Narcissus basilisk.

Sit there, as the sun falls and the night wind rises outside, like the chattering of millions of tiny voices, as a black wing pushes on the creaking window and casts a shadow on a slack face, a writhing shadow.

Full of spiders.
WHAT?? I CANT HEAR YOU
Well there wouldnt be any noise would there
Not until you get a transdimensional mute for your demidaughter's quantum trumpet.  I'm all for the arts, but she's still learning, and the out-of-key existences she's creating keep dumping their inhabitants in my back plane.  You know I work odd hours, I really don't want to deal with that when I could be slumbering until a cult summons me.
It's been many hours and the void is still open. Really don't appreciate this. I'm gonna have to leave this dimension. AGAIN.... For the 5th time. Thanks alot Rachel... Thanks alot... My dimension has gotten used to your dimension and its all your fault.
In space, no one can hear you "REEEEEE"
Wait- How did my Black Hole get here? Did someone steal it while I wasn’t looking?

I accidentally your cat. What do I do?
The cat knows to ring the celestial bell if it wants to exit this universe. There’s no point in leaving that open.
It has the same design plating as farmyard amalgamations but it's emitting Tclass Spice. Not the Arrakis type of spice. This spice is very toxic and can really fuck with space time. That's why I'm losing my hearing. Don't want other senses fucked up to else this will be like the civil wars of Langar all over again
Fuck
No, it was the perpendicular world trolls this time.
No I'm version 9. No exterior buttons or dials
So leaving wormholes open are a viable excuse. I bet they knew before hand this would happen. Wormhole travel costs increase century by century and we have to put up with these flaws. Ridiculous
Liar you always skip years and end up in the cretaceous period
Someone call 9999999999 we got someone trapped
Thank you. I am at ease with your efforts and your kind words to remember the dangers of these realities. Love you.

Right? What the fuck are my taxes even paying for? When I elected Rep. Tek'lash to Dimensional Senate I thought he was going to vote against the new wormhole plan! And don't get me started on the "No Hivespawn Left Behind" Act. The hives have Queens for a reason!

That's the same tek'lash who conquered the Purple Ones in the battle of K'atai 78 998 of the 5th echelon? I didn't even realise he was the same dude.
My eggplant recently hatched into a chickenplant, how long until it starts laying eggplants of its own?
Typically about 14 standard time units.
Just be careful not to cross pollinate it with peas, otherwise you'll end up with chickpeas. That could cause serious ecological problems. Not to mention its bad craftsmanship.
3
I think that depends on where do you exist right now, and the quality of the sacrifices you make for your chickenplant. Usually they tend to idle in a place for a few time units before the very first eggplant laying.
It depends do you have a male chicken plant around to fertilize your female one,  if not I suggest you propagate your chicken-plant

Step 1: cut off chicken plants head 
Step 2: leave plant head out too dry for two days to prevent rot
Step3: put head in ground and water generously 
Was it a chickenplant before it was an eggplant? Or was it a sqrt(eggplant)? This is important to determine its notabotany.
These people are lying to you. It should take about three kilohours for them to explode and go supernova. After all, it's all smooth sailing for eggplant harvesting.
Not sure, but which came first? Chickenplant or eggplant?
It’s probably already too late, ma’am.
You’re lucky you got a chickenplant. The B͉̥̕e̘͞i̮͟n͝g̝͍̺ in the next galaxy over had a Bowelghoul plant.

Help, I set my New Year's resolution too low. 2018 has been pixellated all week. How do I fix this?
It will return to normal when you fail to keep the resolution. 
Go to the store and get a new copy of [the game](/r/outside).
You're just going to have to reboot. I'd suggest you go out and get plastered drunk like it was new years eve, blow some noisemakers, say something regrettable to a close friend, and see if that doesn't fix it. 
Have you considered calling your service provider and yelling at them? You can threaten to go to another provider even though it was your mistake. They'll help you better if you don't acknowledge their personhood, or the fact that they can't help you unless you cooperate. Then they'll politely walk you through the steps to adjust the resolution. When you're done you can yell at them for wasting your time even though most of the time was you complaining. 
You must install Adobe Flash Update to continue. Click the link below. 
I chose to make my New year's resolution a vector in order to avoid this problem all together. I'm not sure of any solutions for you except waiting until next year. 
Mine is fine.  Trust me: you're better off. 
No need to panic. Remember, if you can't find an immediate solution it will reset itself on March first due to the short month of February.
You could skip to 2019. Your resolution will reset, then you can come back to 2018 and do it properly. Don't do it too many times though, you need to be careful
I would just wait. 2018p will soon turn into 2019p, and so on. Just wait until the resolution is sufficient.
Roll back your updates through 2017.
This actually makes sense in a weird way
Too expensive, just restart it
If that doesn't work, go deeper. Throw a Project X style party, but make sure you're able to catch it on the way down
True, but then again all the senses are made in weird ways. Like these things that have an art form based on variations in air pressure; they like gather to sense the air pressure gradients of their favorite pressurists like U2. And the same things have detectors of electromagnetic radiation *built in*, but only for this one ridiculously narrow part of the spectrum, they don't even sense the really bad parts but just, like, this radiation that molten metals and nuclear fission give off. They sample like three different wavelengths and boom! that's supposed to show them what the world looks like.
You're a penguin, what do you know about color vision?
Ah ha ha, the old canard that we penguins do not have color vision! Nonsense! I can see blue, and violet, and green, and ultraviolet, and aquamarine, and turquoise, all the colors, I just look in the sea and it shimmers in all the colors there are.

I'd like to see you... you he-mans echolocate as well as I do!
Uh... you're aware that red, and orange, and yellow also exist, right?
Pah! Never seen any of them. Red is a Communist conspiracy --- the only people who "see red" or talk about "red flags" are dogwhistling Commie sympathizers serving the mummy Lenin.

Oranges are fruit. (How could you not know this?)

And yellow, pah, it's a fake color just like pink, I was told humans are basically pinkish yellow and I waddled over to a few coming across the Ross Ice Shelf and know what? Very sort of bluish white, the whole lot of them. With Communist noses. So there!
I suddenly realize I don't even know if *you're* real.

*looks suspiciously*

You know, just because your user name says penguin doesn't mean you're actually a penguin... ARE YOU A COMMIE SPY??

You seem to Be at gary’s place. Avoid him, his Universe is full of 3 dimensional beings that call him “God”.
you’ll be fine, just define yourself as the origin of your inertial reference frame and remember your relativity. Also, look out for any immovable objects.
No matter where you are..

You have to go down a lot of wrong roads to find the right one.


Get started.
By reading a heart-stopping quote, you'll be able to almost instantly stop. The problem? There's a slight chance that you'll die in the process.
A prime example of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Just forget how fast you’re going and you’ll know.
Just retrace your carbon footprint. If you start to leak prose, you’ve gone too far.
Just read something else that makes you homesick, then climb into the house you vomited.
Just stop moving then.

And now I wander, but a ghost

Also stuck in quatrain land.

It's very late, I ought to sleep,

Yet I sit tapping on my phone.

But I've got rhyming schemes to keep, 

For off to quatrain land I've flown.
I wish that I could come and help today,

But sadly, I am busy back at home.

The fabric of my world's begun to fray, 

And now across my world, the troche roams.

.

Troche causes subtle changes in the

Manner that my lines flow and it's nasty

An English haiku

Its syllables
I was eating mac and cheese and I put it on top of my macbook. The two have cancelled each other and now I have a book made of cheese. How do I get my mac's back?
Play the song “return of the Mac”
This works like matrix multiplication. For future reference, only allow the cheese to touch the book part of the MacBook. Never allow the Mac come in contact with Mac.
In the future you may want to make your mac and cheese in the form of the expression [mac+cheese] that way, unless you split the expression of [mac+cheese]/[macbook] into [mac/[macbook]+[cheese/macbook] it won't be able to cancel out intrinsically. In the mean time, I reccomend placing your [cheese/book] over [cheese/mac]. If you cannot make your own [cheese/mac] store bought is fine.
Not easily. You'll have to multiply by Mac.
If you're a judge or police officer, you could try throwing the book at a Scotsman. If not, try rubbing a macaw over the book and see if it absorbs the mac. You'll need another macaw to remove the cheese, though, and you'll be left with a couple of ethereal "aw" sounds floating around. You could get rid of them by taking them to a vacant lot and using a mirror to transform them into a Wawa.
Take a selfie to reverse cam.
Contrary to popular belief, shelfcheese is quite succulent.
Find some ladies to “mac on” as you are currently set to “mac off”.
Can't guarantee that it will work and you have to be really careful but if you really need your mac and cheese back try looking in the book for an apple reference.


It's a proprietary failsafe mechanism introduced in most universes for situations just like this.
If you've managed to find the apple reference, just take away the apple and put it quickly but gently next to the book.


Do NOT manipulate the book or the apple afterwards or your hands might get coupled with the objects if the phase shift happens while holding them.

 Do NOT place any object between the book or the apple as this might cause a rift in space-time leading right into nearest Apple factory (with a significant fines for the security breach - trust me: you don't want to mess with Apple). 

If all goes well, you will have your macbook and mac and cheese back and fresh next to each other.

If nothing happens for more than two local lifetimes, tough luck. You live in the wrong universe.


Hope it helped and remember: I don't really exist. Just a weird voice in your head. ^^^^Tell ^^^^them ^^^^nothing
Wouldnt it be mac² book-cheese? Asking for a friend.
You should use a coaster next time man
Ok so Mac and Cheese canceled MacBook. So you need to get the Mac back. So get some macaroni and add it to the cheese book. Now you have a MacCheeseBook. Now apply a brick of cheese to cancel out the cheese. This should restore your MacBook.
You must watch the movie Mac & Me three times in a row without your esophagus leaping out and strangling you.
Odd. 

Since when have they had a negative in the "Mac" of the MacBook?
Are you implying you would have some sort of issue with owning a cheese shelf? This sounds like a wonderful predicament. I had a similar issue that resulted in my coming into possession of a cheese cabinet recently. Best mistake of my life.
Reverse it. With some cam.
For posterity, please attempt the combination 2047 more times and report back with what's left.
Post it on facebook, then you'll have a cheese face, ...um... I'm gonna have to think about this one
You just need to check the media access code address of your book of cheese. This will give you an odd number of macs so they’ll no longer be cancelled out.
In line with electricphoenix, you need to get mac to touch the cheese part of the book, therein making a book and mac and cheese. Then cross again, making sure that the mac part touches the book. You may not have any programs left, as you have essentially rebooked the macbook, similar to rebooting but with a book instead of a boot.

Finally, pick up the cheese with a pair of anti-mathematical gloves, and pitch it into the void.
Put the cheese book under a tree root and your macs should come back.
Interlace the sheets of cheese with computer components and then plug it in, the jolt of electricity will fuse the sheets and components together and the resulting fission will bring back your Mac book and macncheese
Convert it back to reality by combining a new mac and a new book. Symbolically good as new!
Or Mac the Knife if you want sharp cheddar
Twice though.
No, because it's mac / mac and then becomes 1. I had a similar problem when I accidentally tripped and my head landed on my phone that had Facebook open. Now I can only communicate with a speaker and microphone I grafted onto my face. The webcams come next week.
Actually, I have an 7th dimension cousin named Roni. So if I bring a roni on top of the macaroni you mentioned I should be able to cancel him and get one mac back.
